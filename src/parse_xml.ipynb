       "  'abstract': 'A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising.',\n",

Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.',\n",

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.\",\n",

The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period.

When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.',\n",

The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment. After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley. 3.

At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg.

Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions.

Octanoic acid, octylamine, and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the active center. L-Phe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 3208). A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above 7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope. These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups. Similar plots of pKm vs. pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8 and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively. All the above substrates (and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group. Similar plots of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively. Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa values between 5 and 9. These data indicate that there are two active center ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since Vmax was constant at all pH values tested.',\n",

The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration.',\n",

Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself.

The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive.

Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Kinetic analyses of monoanion inhibition and 15Cl nuclear magnetic resonance at 5.88 MHz were employed to study monoanion interactions with the zinc metalloenzyme, renal dipeptidase. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine exhibited competitive inhibition when the reaction rate was determined in the presence of the monovalent anions fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, nitrate, or thiocyanate or upon the addition of the divalent anion, sulfate. Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II). The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation. When zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased. Treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor, guanosine triphosphate, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl also produced a significant decrease in the 35Cl line width. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH 5.8-10.8. This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4. Temperature studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature.',\n",

The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.\",\n",

The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds.

A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen.\",\n",

The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for EF-G-GTP binding.

Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion.

The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis.

The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification. Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern.

Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7.

The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites.',\n",

Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.',\n",

The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations.

Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea.

The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP is the highest. The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme. In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum.',\n",

The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix.',\n",

All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.',\n",

Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme.

We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts.

Studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5) M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases.

Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group. The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme. Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture. It is  inferred that the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme. In consequence, the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid. The present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process.\",\n",

The problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states. It is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on polymer formation. The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4. In the absence of added organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from sedimentation equilibrium results. Correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants 1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively.

A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight %, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits  were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group. The shape of the Haemopis erythrocruorin observed by electron microscopy appeared to be consistent with the two-tiered hexagonal array characteristic of annelid erythrocruorins and chlorocruorins.',\n",

However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable, actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.',\n",

This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.',\n",

The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular dichroism and catalytic properties. Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45% of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality.

Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001).

This variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count.

All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine.

This inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla. The heart rate and blood pressure were not affected.

Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen controls. Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition. Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination. Assays after the removal of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to A. flavus were produced by this soil.

Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation.',\n",

The total numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi (measured by dilution plate counts) were greatly reduced in the most severely Zn-contaminated soils compared with control soils. The reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at Lehigh Gap. Growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by 100 to 200 muM Zn, most actinomycetes by 100 muM Zn, and most fungi by 100 to 1000 muM Zn in thin-Pablum extract agar (TPab). All the tested actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from Zn-contaminated Lehigh Gap soils were Zn-tolerant, growing normally in media containing 600-2000 muM Zn. Most fungi, regardless of source, were capable of at least 50% of normal growth at 700 muM Zn. Zinc-tolerant bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were readily isolated from low-Zn soils, suggesting that selection for Zn tolerance may proceed rapidly.

       "  'abstract': 'The interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation (intracarotid injection of nicotine) when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled. The responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation. When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1. After beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade, a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase. However, when ventilation was controlled, intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade. The reflex coronary dilation was not observed after carotid sinus nerve section or after alpha-receptor blockade. Thus, nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components. The minor component involves a chemoreflex with its efferent pathway in tthe vagi. The major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration, and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone. An almost identical period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure. Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+. These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery. The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis.',\n",

Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue. Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts. However, maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts. Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts. At intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and 20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions. Addition of either 10, 20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic, anoxic, and ischemic hearts. The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular pH. It is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts.',\n",

The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing 6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution. The bathing solution contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas mixture. Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial appendage. Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers. At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about 2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached. At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae. At any given load up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula. These results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right ventricle, at least under the conditions of these experiments.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored. In a pH 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760. Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting that these forms are not artifacts.',\n",

In 1963/64, the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals. During summer-seasons (April-October), beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals. Hereby the rate of 137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation. When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle. The lower 137Cs-content in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is at that time less contaminated than green crop. During the winter season (November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage. The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January, February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed. Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle. After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases (Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation.',\n",

The activities of the two enzymes were compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with pNP, pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5. These data disclose pronounced differences with respect to species, substrate and other experimental conditions, thereby precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions. The two enzymes were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and rat liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors. When provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under those conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated.

The final steps of this process occur in the kidney, which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia, and to carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide, by metabolic reactions which adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal ammonia content.

Liver GGT was increased in both cholestasis groups, but the increase was less prominent than the increase in serum GGT and there was no correlation between them.

In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher.

The following results were obtained: 1) Resting arterial blood gases did not change in either group. 2) There was a significant increase of the AaD02 (difference between alveolar p02 and peripheral arterial p02) in cirrhotics and controls. 3) The increase in AaD02 was significantly larger in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing compared to those without EEG - slowing or to the controls. 4) Fractional venous admisture increased significantly in those cirrhotics showing EEG slowing. There was no significant change in those patients who did not show EEG changes or in the controls.',\n",

The extraction procedure can be simplified considerably by prior mixing of the reagents without significantly influencing the results.

The linkage of sulr-c to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical \"low-efficiency\" donor markers equally as efficiently as \"high efficiency\" markers. Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations.

Treatment with acridine orange diminishes the segregant frequency. From the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored. Thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected.

Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state.

Such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine (phenylbutazone + aminopyrine). Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone. Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined. BCP potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A), methylaminoantipyrine (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), which were substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. This potentiation occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola. The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN), isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone (AP), which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position, were not potentiated by BCP in any combination ratio. Most pyrazolones showed additive acute toxicity in their combination with BCP, but acute toxicities of 4A and AM, which were potentiated in analgesic effects, were decreased and antagonized when combined with BCP. The plasma concentration of AM was increased and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP remained much the same. These results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between BCP and pyrazolones, which are substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring.',\n",

Physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but not by IP. The mixture of AM and BCP in aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum, due to the charge transfer interaction. The results of the infrared or NMR spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in non-aqueous media between BCP and AM. From the calculation of the charge on an atom, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density, BCP is considered to be a good electron acceptor. The beta-units of Mho of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs. These results suggest that the complex formation between BCP and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules.',\n",

The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients. Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days. This active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable.

Serotype I, in contrast to all other types studied, lacked ability to consume complement in this system.

Types VII, XII, XIV, and XXV readily activated the alternate pathway in unabsorbed and absorbed sera. Differences could not be related to properties of the capsules. It was concluded that types I, III, IV, and VIII lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be opsonized by the alternate complement pathway, although types III, IV, and VIII can do so in concert with specific antibody.

       "  'abstract': 'Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin (beta-hemolysin). Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis. Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C. The treated cells became susceptible to chelator-induced hemolysis and to hot-cold hemolysis simultaneously, and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase C. Erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to hot-cold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to chelator-induced lysis. Chelators of the EDTA series were the most effective, whereas chelators more specific for Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ were without effect. The rate of chelator-induced lysis was dependent on the preincubation period with beta-hemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added. The optimal concentration of EDTA was found to equal the amount of exogenously added Mg2+, a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase C activity. Hypotonicity increased the rate of chelator-induced hemolysis, whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic completely inhibited chelator-induced lysis. The data suggest that exogenously added and/or membrane-bound divalent cations are important for the stability of sphingomyelin-depleted membranes. The phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization.',\n",

Citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase. L-(+)-Glutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate. D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline, and other metabolites were less effective.',\n",

It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products. The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage.

The work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm. The rate-limiting conversion of acetyl- and beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA to acrylyl CoA by CoA transferase was followed by the non-rate-limiting conversion to beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA by excess crotonase. Thus, a small priming quantity of acetyl CoA served to generate acrylyl CoA, which, by hydration, generated beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA. This product then served to generate more acrylyl CoA in cyclic fashion. The net result was the CoA transferase-limited conversion of acrylate to beta-hydroxypropionate. The purified transferase has a molecular weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each, as determined by disc gel electrophoresis. Short-chain-length monocarboxylic acids are substrates, whereas dicarboxylic or beta-ketocarboxylic acids are not. The reaction kinetics are typical of a ping-pong bi bi mechanism composed of two half reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate. Incubation of the transferase with acetyl CoA in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which, by absorption spectrophotometry, radioactivity measurements, reduction with borohydride, reactivity with hydroxylamine, and catalytic activity, was identified as an enzyme-CoA compound. Kinetic constants for CoA transferase are: final specific activity, 110 U/mg of protein corresponding to 1.38 X 10(4) mumol of acrylate activated per mumol of transferase; Km for acrylate, 1.2 X 10(-3) M; Km for acetyl CoA (beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA), 2.4 X 10(-5) M.',\n",

Among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant. By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan. The organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14 bacterium. EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-32) column. The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan. The products were found to be isomaltose, nigerose, and nigerotriose, with some oligosaccharides. The purified enzyme split the alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main linkages.',\n",

Double-stranded DNA is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of ATP, but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured DNA in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate, and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein.

Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions: fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats. The inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA. The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats. The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection. The injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group. 4. It may be concluded that, in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate.',\n",

The appearance of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 min on the basis of the theory of isomerizing systems in electrophoresis. The transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein net charge, which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a Linderstrøm-Lang pH-tritration plot for the carboxyl groups of alpha-lactalbumin. It was also concluded from the transition curves that the acidfication does not result in complete unfolding, but that a compact structure is maintained in the acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of the protein.

Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces.

       "  'abstract': \"The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone. A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol. Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to 50%. This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Other chelators, e.g. o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect. The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA treatment and dialysis against buffer. Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1 mM could restore the binding to normal levels. Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels. The triiodothyronine cytosol binding activity was nondialyzable, heat-labile. pH-dependent, pronase-digestible, but unaffected by incubation with trypsin, RNase, and DNase, suggesting that the cytosol binding sites are acidic proteins. Scatchard analysis of triiodothyronine binding by the cytosol of different tissues, revealed Kassoc of 7.1 x 10(6) M(-1), 11.6 x 10(6) M(-1), 3.6 X 10(6) M(-1), and 68.0 x 10(6) M(-1) for tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol, respectively. The corresponding maximal binding capacities in picomoles per mg of crude cytosol protein in these four tissues were 10.4, 0.86, 1.3, and 0.04, respectively.\",\n",

(1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5606). To determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Regardless of the form of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16. No activity was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4. These findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e. the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria. Forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates.',\n",

We have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail. In the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue. Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees. The pH optimum for NSILA-s binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to 8.0) for insulin binding. Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity. With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin. Furthermore, six preparations of NSILA-s which varied 70-fold in biological activity competed for 125I-NSILA-s binding in order of their potencies. NSILA-s which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation. Purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other receptors. In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing for the NSILA-s receptor. Analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor.',\n",

The pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein. However, the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species. This reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents. These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate.

       "  'abstract': 'We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that \"fast\" and \"slow\" phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.',\n",

When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes. Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme. Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees. The above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are independent reactions.',\n",

Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies.

The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a \"1-65 heme peptide\" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices.

       "  'abstract': 'Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.',\n",

A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane. Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity. A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent, tetrazolium-reduction system. As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by phagocytosis. Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition. These findings, combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH, indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN. It is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen. Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome.',\n",

Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol.

Nevertheless, serum and pH stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose is present. The amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced. Moreover, the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment. To a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium, but amino acid transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study.

Ethanol was given i.p. in doses of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.',\n",

In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was 60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at 37degreeC. Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility. The most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. It was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level. Diffusible calcium in synovial fluid was only 40% of the total calcium concentration, which means most joint fluids are normally near the critical concentration of 5 mg/100 ml of ionized calcium, below which solubility is enhanced. During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall, favoring dissolution of CPPD crystals. We speculate that the slight decrease in crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold, resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are \"shed\" into the joint space. Crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid pH accompanying the inflammatory response.',\n",

Biochemical analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult. These data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule. Postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth. Elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of ER were often in close apposition. Extensive interactions between segments of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in 0.5-mu sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope. In contrast to peroxisomes, neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase, suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete development of the kidney.',\n",

Bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a pH of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation. At pH values below about 6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt, and a low activity peak is seen around pH 5.5. This is the result of the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" and the activity of the catalytic site. In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished.

This does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation. This may occur over a period of several minutes, which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals. 3. Physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc, oral disc, tentacles and pharynx. 4.

This effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by decarboxylation of L-histidine. A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils. The attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or H-2 receptor antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine, an H-2 receptor antagonist. The effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells. The ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility. Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a.

In the case of fish hemoglobins, some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems. It appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in general. The trout hemoglobin system is an example. Distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligand-binding mechanism. Characterization of the multiple, structurally distinct subunits of the 60S Limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its function. Our studies suggest the possibility of using Limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays. The rapid development of molecular structural data from X-ray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science.\",\n",

Appreciation of qualitative regularities (\"permitted sequences\") and quantitative regularities (\"selectivity isotherms\") in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers. Discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces. \"Black-box\" studies on intact biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers. Major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function. Further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes, of voltage-dependent (\"excitable\") conducting channels, and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however, both rotational and translational diffusion are possible. In the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation is less clear. There is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on Brownian rotation. (3) In the outer segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance, possibly mediated by calcium ions. In most invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance, principally to sodium ions. A subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane, due to a decrease in sodium conductance. (4) For vertebrate receptors, log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached (Dowling-Rushton relationship). The proportionality constant varies in different preparations from less than four to more than 30, and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown. For invertebrates, by contrast, the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch. (5) In most species, vertebrate and invertebrate, the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on membrane conductance, but several possible exceptions exist. (6) Photoregeneration of rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects, but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla. In no single case are they adequately understood.',\n",

Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane. Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum.

It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.',\n",

Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations. The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation.

A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables. Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase. Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals.',\n",

The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection. The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin.',\n",

No persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate, as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanol-drinking mice. Enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl COA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking. The increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic acids. These findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats. Ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue. In summary of the present studies, accelerated lipogenesis and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic fatty liver of KK-Ay mice.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'FHR monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures, and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both, the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the FHR. The major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of \"falsely abnormal\" cases, i.e. cases in which the fetal pH falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good (APGAR greater than or equal to 7). In our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2% (Tab. I). In the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother (maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis). The importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised, rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds, although it is in fact unnecessary, since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus. Various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis. These include the feto-maternal difference in base deficit (F/M deltaBD), the materno-fetal differences in pHqu 40 (M/F deltapHqu 40) the materno-fetal difference actual pH (M/F actual deltapH), and the materno-fetal difference in base deficit of the extra-cellular fluid (M/F deltaBDHb5). A critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a 5 year period (1968-1972) at the First Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Milan University. The cases comprised 59 regarded as normal (normal course of pregnancy, spontaneous commencement of labor at term, clear amniotic fluid, regular FHR, spontaneous birth, APGAR at 90 sec between 8 and 10, weight at birth greater than 2500 g), and 335 considered to be at risk (maternal disease, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in FHR). In all of these cases the FHR was recorded by cardiotokography, and the tracings were interpreted according to HON. Microsamples of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out: actual pH, pHqu 40, Hb concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, base deficit Hb5 (BDHb5). The maternofetal differences were then calculated. The same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery. The clinical condition of the infant was evaluated by the APGAR score at 90 seconds after birth.',\n",

In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CS. These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine.

       "  'abstract': 'Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson\\'s disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent. The activities of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined. In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change. The activities of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls. The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region. Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with L-dopa shortly before death. The mean concentrations of DA in the striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as \"good responders\" as compared to \"poor responders.\" Although L-dopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase was observed in the striatum. It was concluded that L-dopa\\'s principal therapeutic effects in Parkinson\\'s disease are consistent with its transformation to DA in the striatum.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT). alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and the depletion of DA. After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.',\n",

In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine could be determined. 2. A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin. 3. Graded decrease of the liver extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0. Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0. This pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion. 4. The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide, which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal. 5.

       "  'abstract': \"1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"1. A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques. 2. During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon. 3. The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development. However the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm. 4. During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal m.e.p.p. amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s. were not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s. of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p. had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s. if these had a unimodal distribution. 5. Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated legs. 6. These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites.\",\n",

Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum.

It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein. The properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural element.',\n",

Both renins, unknown and standard, react with a sheep substrate preparation and are handled identically throughout the whole procedure including the angiotensin I radioimmunoassay (RIA).

Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.',\n",

Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo. 1. According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20 post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine. The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline, phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59 and 7.69, respectively. 2. For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline. All agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation. According to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20 pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. 10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right. 3. The ratio EC20 pre/EC20 post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and presynaptic potency. According to the ratios, the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups. Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline, adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as well as clonidine). 4. Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation. Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but never reduced, the response. In contrast, oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz). 5. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha-receptors. Pre- and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses. The preferential activation of presynaptic alpha-receptors results in alpha-adrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission.',\n",

Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) decreased the apparent Km of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor. However, when GHBA was injected before haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent Kn of TH, in a dose related manner. In vitro GHBA (10(-4) M) neither changed the stimulation of the striatal adenylyl cyclase by DA nor its inhibition by haloperidol. These results suggest that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the Kn of TH for the pteridine cofactor is regulated by an molecuular mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in the DA neurons is unimpaired.',\n",

Experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion. Kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well. Renal artery infusion of NH4 acetate or intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 during arterial infusion of NH4Cl prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes, but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented.

Although both enzymes are serine hydrolases, several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been observed. In this report particular attention is focused on the second-order reaction constant, kcat/Kapp. While the reported pH dependence and deuterium oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base catalysis, this study finds a more complicated situation with acetylcholinesterase. The apparent pKa of kcat/Kapp for acetylcholinesterase varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear inhibition by [H+]. Deuterium oxide isotope effects for kcat/Kapp range from 1.1 for acetylcholine to 1.9 for p-nitrophenyl acetate. The bimolecular reaction rate appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations, while a rate-limiting induced-fit step is proposed to account for apparent pKa values and low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl acetate and isoamyl acetate.',\n",

T. & Vallee, B. L. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2532-2535) is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events. The interconversion of the azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and temperature-jump methods. The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1). Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn complex before hydrolysis occurs. As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248, substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress. The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis. If azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes. AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step. These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process.',\n",

In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site.

Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions. Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras. The introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells. The findings suggest that T-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation. These investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Alternatively, the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections. The higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection. These observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation.

       "  'abstract': 'During penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type. (ii) Mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type autolysin to the growth medium. Chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme. Sensitivity of the cells to exogenous autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine or fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone has no effect on bacterial growth. (iii) Treatment with penicillin (or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis) causes the escape into the medium of a choline-containing macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen). Each one of these three phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization to exogenous autolysin, and leakage of lipoteichoic acid) shows the same dose response as that of the penicillin-induced lysis of wild-type pneumococci. On the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillin-induced lysis of bacteria. It is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) and autolytic enzyme. Escape of lipoteichoic acid-like material to the growth medium is a consequence of this labilization. Chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillin-induced lysis by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme, rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface.',\n",

The complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as 60 ng of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum. Acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the folate-binder complex. Released folates were separated from binder by Sephadex gel filtration, zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients, or adsorption onto activated charcoal. The separated binding factor, either saturated or unsaturated with folate, had a molecular weight of about 40,000 on Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Binding of [3H]pteroylglutamic acid was rapid and, as in the original endogenous folate-binder complex, was essentially irreversible at neutral pH. The affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using [3H]pteroylglutamic acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives. Oxidized folates were bound in preference to reduced derivatives, but only three to four times more unlabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an equal level of competition.

These studies identify two distinct processes. Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex. Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations. These two conformations can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is three to four orders of magnitude faster than II. Mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5. In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. & Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.

The failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single, slow rate. The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid. The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis. In crystals, rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted, and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations. In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for carboxypeptidase A. In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals, conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis.\",\n",

In the present paper, two experiments are described which examine how repeated exposure to such stressors affects (a) shuttle avoidance-escape performance (Experiment 1), and (b) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that, whereas subjects receiving the single exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidance-escape deficit, subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor. Experiment 2 showed that, whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock, subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical \"habituation.\" Subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no depletion of norepinephrine level, and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of 3H-norepinephrine by slices of cortex in vitro.

While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil. Decrease of blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o.

Hence, under our assay conditions, the soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+. Finally, microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of SS.',\n",

The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma.

At various pH values between 7.38 and 7.55 the Hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of O2 saturation, the Hill coefficient being 2.9. Half saturation pressure P50 at pH = 7.50 was 36 torr. The Bohr effect factor was -0.53. Buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood samples with gas mixtures of different PCO2 at 41 degrees C. The buffer value for whole blood in the range of 3-7% CO2 was 19.3 mMol-L-1-pH-1, the buffer value for true plasma 22.9 mMol-L-1-pH-1. The CO2 dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a slope of 0.17 mMol-L-1-torr-1 in the PCO2 range from 40 to 50 torr. The CO2 content of oxygenated blood at PCO2 = 40 torr was 21.7 mMol-L-1. The Haldane effect factor at PCO2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mMol of combined CO2 per mMol HbO2. With the values of PO2, PCO2 and pH measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained, resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both O2 and CO2 were constructed assuming a metabolic R.Q. of 0.8.

The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG. It is concluded that a rise in PACO2 results in a rise in VG and that changes in pH in blood or water have little direct effect on VG in rainbow trout.

The first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a logarithmic-linear pattern and are expressed as relative rates: The initial post-ingestion process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes, the basic or exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern as deltabeta. Each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied. We confirmed the earlier claims that pyloroplasty alone does not change the emptying rate of liquid meals. Each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently across the operations from meal to meal tested. Initial emptying after all three vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, probably indicative of gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation. The basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations studied. The basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical, slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty. Possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers, sectioned only with truncal vagotomy, in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids.',\n",

Gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or plasminogen could be demonstrated. In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice. These patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated. It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin). The patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture. The gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates. The activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA. The occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice. By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin. The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP. These findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum. There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency. The effect of administration of AMCA on fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism.',\n",

Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index (BUI). Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a 45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose. Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100 mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues. Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect. Hypocapnia (PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition. When BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments, there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression.

These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic.

       "  'abstract': 'Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study. Biochemical investigations were reported on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of 3H-dopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages, to provide quantitative data for correlation with the fluorexcence information. The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life. The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone. Their fluorescent axons, which form the nigroneostriatal pathway, reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and ramify extensively in the putamen by day 20, but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later. Some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large. Electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses. A distinct substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation. Electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites, some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions. The subsequent maturaition of these cells and the neuropil is described. The fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life. Occasionally, minute beaded fluorescent axons are found. These profiles might correspond to some of the axons with varicosities \"en passage\" revealed by electron microscopy. In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing axon, the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was reported. Axonal varicosities \"en passage\" containing a dense \"tag\" in the vesicles were found. Most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic contacts.

       "  'abstract': \"The nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii. By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds. Accumulation of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine, 2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups. This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process. Consequently, flavinogenesis in P. guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism. A change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme. Incubation of the cells rich in iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide. A deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells. Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis. Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo. With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis. The properties were studied for 680 time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN. A change in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species. Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii.\",\n",

An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence. These early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms. However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms. Furthermore, the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2). The data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results. The observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence. However, the binding of imidazole to the binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes. The observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex(es). A substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme. Nine models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all). Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle. The ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside. The interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole. If it would be shifted very much to the side of the \"dead-end\" complex (as in isobutyramide?!), stimulating action could not take place.',\n",

On the other hand, whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine, the mean ICP increased, mostly due to augmented capillary filtration. The hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient. The action of acetylcholine was complex: large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration, but small doses increased the mean ICP by muscle stimulation only.

       "  'abstract': 'To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content (TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2. Second, by reducing CMRO2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level.',\n",

Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing.

No qualitative differences were found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains. They had identical heat inactivation curves, pH optima, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, and the Km values were very similar. It thus seems that this genetic difference in enzyme activity probably cannot be explained by a variation of the galactosidase-specific activity but rather reflects a difference in number of enzyme molecules. Eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver, kidney, and spleen. Each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point.

The total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice. In liver, the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice. The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice. Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell.',\n",

To identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of beta-glycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from pig kidney, the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the pH range 6.6-10.3 at substrate concentrations of 3 muM-30 mM. From the plots of log VH+ against pH and log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional groups with pK = 9.1 were identified. These groups are involved in substrate binding. Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion. 2. GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II). 3. The influence of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0. The binding of substrate and activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0. The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration. The Mg2+ ions are bound by a functional group with a pK of 10.15. 4. A scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation is derived. 5. The mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model. Mg2+ seems to play a role as an autosteric effector.',\n",

Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic acid) were used. Both kcat. and kcat./Km for both substrates gave bell-shaped plots of parameter versus pH. The pH-dependence of kcat./Km for the two substrates gave the same value (8.6) for the higher apparent pK, and so this value may characterize a group on the free enzyme; the lower apparent pK values were about 5(4.85 for benzylpenicillin, 5.4 for ampicillin). For benzylpenicillin both kcat. and kcat./Km depended on pH in exactly the same way. The value of Km for benzylpenicillin was thus independent of pH, suggesting that ionization of the enzyme's catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this substrate. The pH-dependence of kcat. for ampicillin differed, however, presumably because of the polar group in the side chain. The hypothesis that the pK5 group is a carboxyl group was tested. Three reagents that normally react preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme: the reagents were Woodward's reagent K, a water-soluble carbodi-imide, and triethyloxonium fluoroborate. These findings tend to support the idea that a carboxylate group plays a part in the action of beta-lactamase I.\",\n",

Another oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme which separated on DEAE-chromatography also showed formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester oxidase activity, albeit to a lesser extent. The properties of the two isoenzymes of the oxidase were compared and shown to differ in their oxidation and peroxidation properties. The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase. The Datura isoenzymes exhibited typical haemoprotein spectra.

The results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for RNA labelled for short periods (up to 2h).

The activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue. In higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases, whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals. This suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is far-removed from equilibrium. If it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle, the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle. This suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue. 2. The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated. However, the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach.

       "  'abstract': 'Reaction of phenacetin with N2O4 in glacial acetic acid at 10(0) C gives N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide. This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature. No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1). Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found. Under the conditions applied, the N-nitrosoacylarylamine rapidly rearranges by 1,3-migration of the acetyl group. The resulting diazoester dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt. Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation. The yields obtained in dilute aqueous nitrosation mixtures are lower than expected; the reasons for this finding are discussed. Preliminary results of animal experiments show that the N-nitroso compound is a directly acting carcinogen.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The substance 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin, for its atropine-like properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene. The anti-histamine and anti-serotonin activities of compound WA 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene. WA 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors. In the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect, its oral absorption is very good. The anti-anaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine. Like pimethixene and cyproheptadine, WA 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin. The anticholinergic effects of WA 335 are dependent on the test object. In examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse, the atropine-like efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat. WA 335 has distinct central atropine-like properties. It possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity. The effects of WA 335 on circulation are dependent on species. In contrast to pimethixene, compound WA 335 like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats. The reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after WA 335 than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine. Higher doses of WA 335 than are necessary to demonstrate antaminic effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects. WA 335 shows no analgesic potency in mice. The influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine. WA 335 is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice, and shows the same anti-emetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs. In contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of WA 335 which cause a slight sedation.',\n",

In bile salt solutions in which the phospholipid concentration was constant on a molar basis, in solubility of palmitic acid decreased linearly with the progressive replacement of lecithin by lysolecithin.

       "  'abstract': 'As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7. The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402. The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15% loss in helicity. The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered. The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin. Bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains.',\n",

The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2.

Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin.',\n",

A considerable change in the base composition of PNP-degraded RNA is observed at different incubation times of total polyribosomes with 32P-orthophosphate: G+C//A+U ratio increased from 2.3 to 3.1, and purines/pyrimidines ratio-from 0.47 to 1.06 with the increase of the incubation time. Specific activity of PNP in ribosome fractions obtained under ultracentrifugation of total polyribosomes in succrose density gradient (0.3-1.0 M) increased in the direction from the fraction of heavy polysomes to trimers and dimers and then dropped at the region of monomers (80 S particles).

       "  'abstract': 'The effect of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity of a number of energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles ot phospholipases A, C and D has been studied. It has been shown that in the conditions of oxidation of NADH and succinate by oxygen and also of ATP hydrolysis, the decrease in the phosphorylating activity of the particles under the action of phospholipases C and D accelerates. No such acceleration has been observed with phospholipase A. For other two functions, i. e. reverse electron transfer (ATP-dependent NAD+ reduction by succinate) and ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction the results proved to be different. Oxidizable substrates and ATP promoted the maintenance of these functions in the presence of phospholipase A, but did not retard their suppression by phospholipases C and D. The effects of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity  of different energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles to phospholipases A, C and D could be removed by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. The conclusion is made that the effects revealed are associated with an increase in the sensitivity of coupling sites II PAND/OR III to phospholipases C and D and with a decrease in the sensitivity of sites I and IV to phospholipase A on energization of submitochondrial particles.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another. Catalysis by those systems implies, therefore, that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves, with activatory and/or inhibitory ligands (H+, H2O, metals, etc.) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules. The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems. Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems. This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins. Similarly, the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxido-reduction of electron carriers to induced-fit effects leading to a sequence of ATPase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy transducing organelles.',\n",

The Michaelis constant and Vmax of soluble subtilisin BPN' with TAME were two and one orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than with ethyl lactate. Vmax, calculated per g of active enzyme, with TAME as the substrate was not affected by immobilization, while Vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold. The apparent KM decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with TAME.

Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the liver. The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient. It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, HL-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD. Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between HL-A and MLC-identical siblings. However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection. The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated HL-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'To examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and two of its target organs, the iris and pineal gland, were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches. During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat. These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane. These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia. It is concluded that trans-synaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end organ innervation by SCG.',\n",

However, Zn2+ has to be present on the apoenzyme to obtain this activation. Mg2+ alone is unable to reconstitute functional active sites. Excess Zn2+ which competes for the Mg2+ site leads to a phosphatase with little catalytic activity at alkaline pH but with normal active sites at acidic pH as shown by covalent incorporation of ortho-[32P]phosphate. Two enzyme species with identical functional active sites have been reconstituted that only differ by the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+ at the effector site.

GP I Barcelona was a fast variant (116%) with an increased isoelectric point (9.55), lability to heat and to urea, and shift of the pH curve towards the acidic pH. The other kinetic characteristics were normal.

Six monkeys that were exposed to a mean calculated alveolar fluroxene concentration of 5.8% for 4-hr periods up to a total of 16 hr showed no evidence of toxicity. Two animals were sacrificed after a single 4-hr exposure to obtain control measures of fluroxene metabolites in tissues. Four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital (mean time, 3 hr). Toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arterial hypoxemia. Phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites, including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol. Concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixed-expired gas, blood, and urine, and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood, urine, and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals. The results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of fluroxene pharmacology and that inclusion of an enzyme-inducing challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted.',\n",

The data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured. If the dose ratio to isoproterenol (DR) is measured, then (DR-1) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration. On the other hand, if propranolol's effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response, then this declines linearly with time, even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially. This fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life.\",\n",

Plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for PCA and N-acetyl PCA (NAPA) analysis. Urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states (approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min, respectively), and urine pH varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states (pH = ca 5 vs 8, respectively). Despite this marked variation, there were no significant changes in PCA renal clearance or 24-hr PCA or NAPA excretion. If passive diffusion of PCA were taking place, such flow and pH changes would have caused marked changes in PCA clearance were the pH partition hypothesis true. We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion.

In isolated perfused liver, most of the drug (59% of dose) was excreted into bile within 4 hr, primarily as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (24% of dose) and 6-methylgriseofulvin (24% of dose). In animals with bile duct cannulas, 65% of the dose was excreted into bile and 18% of the dose into urine within 4 hours. In bile, 32% of the dose was excreted as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 20% of the dose as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, whereas in urine the drug was excreated predominantly as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (13% of dose) with only a small amount of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1% of dose), during the first 4 hr. These results show that there is good correlation in the metabolic fate of 14C-griseofulvin in the liver microsomes, isolated perfused liver, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In addition to the similar ratio of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, there is also an agreement in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused liver and in rats with bile duct cannulas, which suggests that the isolated perfused liver is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The mixed-function oxidation of 14C-labled 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was investigated in placental and fetal tissues of humans and monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) in vitro. The major metabolite formed in most tissues was 7-hydroxy-AAF. Rates of the hydroxylation reactions varied widely among the tissues investigated and were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in rat hepatic tissues. High correlations among rates of 7-,5-, and 3- and between 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed. The latter two reactions were less responsive to inhibition by carbon monoxide. Rates of 3-hydroxylations of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) also were highly correlated with rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF but were not correlated with rates of 1- and N-hydroxylations in human placental microsomes. A lack of statistically significant correlations was observed among rates of many of these hydroxylation reactions studied in primate fetal tissues. Rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF were not statistically correlated with rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP in homogenates of primate fetal tissues in most instances, but statistically significant correlations among rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP and 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed in those preparations. The results suggested two separate mechanisms for the genetic control of rates of placental aromatic ring- and N-hydroxylation reactions as opposed to apparent multiple genetic controls for rates of these hydroxylation reactions in primate fetal tissues.',\n",

The 24-hr LD50 of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over 25 days of age. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine, the distribution of 3H after the administration of 3H-colchicine (0.1 mg/kg) was measured in 10- and 35-day-old rats. The concentration of 3H was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the adult after ip administration, suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine elimination. After iv administration, radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult. This was due to a lower capacity of the liver of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile. Development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in LD50. These results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the newborn because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process.',\n",

Both recirculating and single-pass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as perfusate. Aldrin accumulated in the lung from the perfusate through two distinct phases of uptake: a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin. Dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a nonsaturable process. Single-pass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism. Uptake of dieldrin was biphasic: one phase independent of the perfusate concentration and the other saturable with respect to the perfusate concentration. By the application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be 0.64 mumol/lung. Our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding. There was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin, its epoxide, in the lung.

However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug.

The assay of cytochrome P-450 in liver homogenate is accurate enough to calculate a reproducible recovery factor.

The limits of this method include overestimation of homogenate cytochrome P-450 and inability to correct for nonmicrosomal protein contamination. Overestimation of cytochrome P-450 can be corrected by measuring the difference in absorbance between 450 and 510 nm with the extinction coefficient of 100 mM-1cm-1. To be accurate, cytochrome P-450 determination on microsomes must be done at protein concentrations of about 3 mg/ml. The error inherent to the method may be kept constant and minimal.

       "  'abstract': \"Epileptiform after discharges evoked by repetitive electrical stimulation of chronically isolated cortical slabs (cat) were shortened by low doses of phenobarbital but not affected by hypnotic doses of pentobarbital. Both pentobarbital and phenobarbital raised threshold and lowered spike amplitude in isolated sciatic nerves. The action of both drugs was increased by reducing Na in the medium and by decreasing the Ringer's pH. Similar to the action of other general anesthetics, the axonal effect of pentobarbital was enhanced by D2O replacement for H2O in the Ringer's (suggesting that tissue water is involved in pentobarbital action), whereas D2O replacement did not modify the action of phenobarbital or of local anesthetics. These results suggest that the varying in vivo effects of pentobarbital and phenobarbital may be due to a difference in their action upon excitable membranes (rather than to a different regional distribution in brain).\",\n",

Chemical analysis of the inactivated enzyme after sodium borohydride reduction shows that 11 argi-ine and 11 lysine residues per mole are modified.

Chemical analysis shows that 4 arginine and 3 lysine residues per mole are modified in the enzyme at the maximum of activation. At pH 7.0 the enzyme undergoes a 4-fold activation. Chemical analysis shows that in this activated enzyme 3 lysine and no arginine residues per mole have been modified.

       "  'abstract': 'In delta-chymotrypsin the reactivity of methionine-192 towards p-nitrophenacyl bromide is strongly reduced when the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 has been acetylated. Since acetylation of isoleucine-16 brings delta-chymotrypsin to a conformation similar to its alkaline one this suggests that methionine-192 should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein. It is indeed observed that its chemical reactivity as a function of pH depends on the ionization state of the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 (pKapp 9 at 15 degrees C) as does the structure of the enzyme. Reciprocally, after chemical reaction of methionine-192 with hydrogen peroxide, isoleucine-16 presents a slower rate of reaction with fluorescamine than when methionine-192 is free. As a result of methionine-192 oxidation the apparent pK of the alkaline transition is shifted from 9 to about 11 at 15 degrees C. This is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline pH [Eur. J. Biochem. (1973) 39,293-300]. The absence of chemical reactivity of methionine-192 in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at alkaline pH. Such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral pH. Since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state, the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine-16 and methionine-192 during this isomerization process. They also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine-192 has moved back into the interior of the protein. Since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the high-pH form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that methionine-192 occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen.',\n",

Of the 37 amino groups present per enzyme subunit, 2-3 of these groups might be located in the proximity of the region of subunit interactions. The 50% loss of the initial activity, which follows the succinylation of these more reactive amino groups, does not seem to be due to the modification of a residue on the enzyme active site or to a change of the tertiary structure of the protein. This 50%loss of the enzyme activity may be related to the dissociation of the dimer into monomers. Both native enzyme and the succinylated subunits have the same H-dependent denaturation rate profiles in response to 2 M urea. Moreover, the apparent pK of the group involved in the transition from a more stable conformation of the protein in the acid range to a less stable one at alkaline pH seems to be similar to the pK of the group implicated in the transition between the protonated inactive form of the enzyme and an active deprotonated form.

The reaction was monitored by malonaldehyde measurements. Upon the addition of iron, malonaldehyde production in the cells started immediately but ceased within 30-60 min, and the response was dose-related with iron concentrations ranging from 19 to 187 muM. Malonaldehyde formation was associated with increased oxygen uptake and conjugated diene production. The addition in vitro of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, menadione or p-benzoquinone inhibited the iron-induced malonaldehyde production. It was also possible to demonstrate an apparent disappearance of malonaldehyde from fresh cells by addition of adequate amounts of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (100 muM). The attenuation of the iron-induced malonaldehyde production was found to be correlated with an increased binding of iron to an intracellular ferritin fraction. Further, malonaldehyde formation was also associated with a conversion of reduced glutathione to the oxidized form which, in turn, revealed a faster permeation out of the cells into the surrounding medium of the oxidized than of the reduced thiol. So, concomitant with the redox alterations, there was also an overall loss of glutathione from the cells. Cumene hydroperoxide-induced malonaldehyde production could be initiated by the addition of this peroxide in concentrations ranging from 150 muM to the liver cell incubate. With concentrations below 150 muM, a lag phase was present which seemed to be glutathione-dependent. It is concluded that iron enters the cell, then is probably reduced inside the cell by NADPH via the NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and in the reduced state initiates lipid peroxidation. The reaction is inhibited by intracellular mechanisms, the glutathione redox system being of principal importance, and possibly terminated by the iron-apoferritin complex formation.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': '1. The existence of two different D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases in Pseudomonas fluorescens has been demonstrated. Based on their different specificity and their different metabolic regulation one enzyme is appointed to the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the other to the hexose monophosphate pathway. 2. A procedure is described for the isolation of that D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which forms part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (Entner-Doudoroff enzyme). A 950-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of 44%. The final preparation, having a specific activity of about 300 mumol NADH formed per min per mg protein, was shown to be homogeneous. 3. The molecular weight of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been determined to be 220000 by gel permeation chromatography, and that of the other enzyme (Zwischenferment) has been shown to be 265000. 4. The pI of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been shown to be 5.24 and that of the Zwischenferment 4.27. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme is stable in the range of pH 6 to 10.5 and shows its maximal activity at pH 8.9. 5. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme showed specificity for NAD+ as well as for NADP+ and exhibited homotropic effects for D-glucose 6-phosphate. It is inhibited by ATP which acts as a negative allosteric effector. Other nucleoside triphosphates as well as ADP are also inhibitory. 6. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at carbon-1 of beta-D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate to the si face of carbon-4 of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as B-side stereospecific dehydrogenase.',\n",

It displays a restricted growth spectrum, being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative alicyclic alcohols and ketones. Cyclohexanol-grown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 mumol of O2/mumol substrate. Cyclohexanone is oxidized at a similar rate with the consumption of 4.85 mumol of O2/mumol. 1-Oxa-2-oxocycloheptane and 6-hydroxyhexanoate are both oxidized at the same slow rate of 44 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt and adipate is not oxidized.

The partition is measured under conditions where contributions from electrostatic interactions are eliminated. The difference in partition of proteins in phase systems with and without hyrocarbon groups bound to poly(ethylene glycol), deltalog K, where K is the partition coefficient, is taken as a measure of hydrophobic interaction. Deltalog K varies with size of hydrocarbon chain and type of protein. The length of the aliphatic chain should be greater than 8 carbon atoms in order to get a measurable effect in terms of deltalog K. Bovine serum albumin, beta-lactoglobulin, hemoglobin and myoglobin have been shown to have different affinities for palmitic acid ester of poly(ethylene glycol).

       "  'abstract': 'Rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase, spin-labelled at its most reactive thiol group, has an electron spin resonance spectrum which is very sensitive to the binding of substrates and allosteric effectors. The spectral changes have been interpreted in terms of a concerted allosteric transition between two conformational states with non-exclusive binding of effectors. On this basis MgATP, fructose 6-phosphate plus ATP, and NH+4ions behave as potent positive effectors, inorganic phosphate, sulphate, AMP, fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate are less potent activators, and free ATP and H+ions are negative effectors, in agreement with the kinetic behaviour, but citrate behaves anomalously. In addition, the allosteric equilibrium can be displaced towards the inhibited state by selectively modifying two further thiol groups. Strong positive cooperativity occurs under suitable conditions with ATP, metal-ATP and fructose 6-phosphate. Biphasic changes of conformation, attributed to binding at the catalytic and inhibitory sites, have been observed in titrations with ATP. The differentiation of the two ATP binding sites arises in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate because of a distinct concerted effect on conformation between the two substrates at the active site. A similar effect occurs between ATP and citrate. Other heterotropic effects are more consistent with simple models; phosphates favour the binding, and reduce the cooperativity, of fructose 6-phosphate and metal-ATP, whereas excess ATP and H+ ions antagonise the binding and increase the cooperativity of fructose 6-phosphate. The observations are related to existing kinetic and binding studies where possible. Anomalous features of the behaviour suggest that the model should be regarded only as a first approximation.',\n",

Porphyrin cytochrome c does not substitute for native cytochrome c in either the oxidase reaction or in restoring electron transport in cytochrome-c-depleted mitochondria. It does however competitively inhibit native cytochrome c in these reactions, the Ki for inhibition being larger than the Km for reaction. The absorption and emission spectra, and the polarized excitation spectrum of the porphyrin cytochrome c are characteristic of free base porphyrin. The absence of fluorescence quenching of porphyrin cytochrome c  when the protein is bound to cytochrome oxidase suggests that heme to heme distance between these proteins is larger than 0.5 to 0.9 nm depending upon orientation. Binding of the porphyrin cytochrome c to phospholipids or to mitochondria increases the fluorescence polarization of a positively polarized absorption band, which indicates that the bound form of the protein does not rotate freely within the time scale of relaxation from the excited state.',\n",

The biotin is bound to the heavier subunit. It was previously found that 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase contains four biotin molecules per complex. A complex composed of four of each subunit would thus have a molecular weight of about 700000. This is compatible with the molecular weight of 760000 determined earlier by analytical ultracentrifugation. Both subunits were isolated preparatively. As the subunits, unlike the complex, are very sensitive to oxygen, special precautions had to be taken during isolation. The biotin-containing subunit was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 5 M urea. It no longer catalyzed the overall reaction, yet could still carboxylate free biotin. The biotin-free subunit was separated after dissociation of the enzyme by three-days' dialysis at pH 9.8 under nitrogen. On chromatography over a Sepharose-bound avidin column, the biotin-subunit was fixed and the biotin-free subunit was eluted unretarded. The latter subunit showed no enzymic activity. After the addition of the biotin-containing subunit, overall activity was regenerated. The speed of reassociation is very much enhanced by 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. It was shown by reassociation experiments under different conditions that probably an initial complex, AxBy is formed, possessing a binding site for 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA. Upon the binding of this substrate the conformation may be changed to a form favourable for reconstitution. Finally, the structures of biotin enzymes from different sources are compared.

They have been chemically characterized by the use of a 14C-labeled reagent, by peptide mapping techniques following hydrolysis by pronase and chymotrypsin, and by spectroscopy. Acetylation in sodium acetate (pH 5.5) results in a full substitution of the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal histidyl residue, but in a partial (about 0.3 acetyl group per residue) substitution of the epsilon-amino group of the lysyl residue 12. The monosubstituted (on the alpha-amino group) and the disubstituted (on both amino groups) acetylated components have been separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. Acetylation in sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) results in a complete substitution of both amino groups and of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosyl residues 10 and 13. Complete deacetylation of the O-acetyltyrosyl residues occurs upon treatment with hydroxyl-amine. Mono, di and tetraacetylglucagon are homogeneous when analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis; di and tetrasubstituted derivatives show an increased mobility towards the anode. 125I-labeled derivatives of acetylglucagon show higher distribution coefficients in the aqueous two-phase dextran/poly(ethylene glycol) system than do similar derivatives of glucagon. Acetylation decreases in parallel the ability of glucagon to stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase and to bind to its receptors in liver cell membranes of the rat. The biological potencies of the mono, di and tetrasubstituted derivates are, respectively, about 10, 1 and 0.1% that of native glucagon. The binding properties of the material dissociated from the acetylglucagon-receptor complex suggest that the reduction in biological activity results from a decrease in the intrinsic affinity of the modified glucagon for the receptors, as well as from the presence of small amounts of residual, unreacted glucagon. Studies with 125I-labeled derivatives of glucagon indicate that acetylation decreases the rate of association and increases the rate of dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex.',\n",

It appeared that in all cases the binding to chicken hemoglobin is much stronger than to human hemoglobin. This is very probably due to the fact that 4 out of the 12 residues, responsible for the binding of phosphates in chicken hemoglobin, are arginines. These are absent in human hemoglobin, where the binding site is made up to only 8 residues. For chicken hemoglobin one strong binding site could be observed in both unliganded and liganded hemoglobin.

At optimal pH and in the absence of acceptors, the enzyme catalyzes the release of about 510 mumol of p-nitroaniline per mg protein per min from the model substrate L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a sodium dodecylsulfate buffer system showed the presence of a large (Mr approximately 65000) and a small (Mr approximately 27000) polypeptide chain. Dissociation into two polypeptide chains was also achieved in 8 M urea. Amidination with dimethylsuberimidate produced a crosslinked protein of molecular weight approximately 90000. In the course of this work a convenient procedure was developed for the determination of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity using L[glycine-2-3H]glutathione as the substrate. In this procedure the release of cysteinyl-[2-3H]glycine from glutathione is followed, after separation of the radioactive di-peptide from unreacted glutathione on a small Dowex-1 acetate column. The reactions with gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide and glutathione are both strongly activated by several metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+) and by a number of amino acids and peptide acceptors. The products of the reaction with glutathione were identified as cysteinylglycine, gamma-glutamylglutathione and glutamate. The formation of these products is consistent with the function of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in both the gamma-glutamyl transfer reaction and in the hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl bond. The activating effect of metal ions in the reaction with glutathione was shown to be dependent on the acceleration of the transfer reaction; the rate of hydrolysis of the gamma-glutamyl bond remaining unchanged.',\n",

The rat liver microsomes caused a rapid hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid to D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and further although much slower to free D-glucuronic acid. In Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) they were produced in ratio 72 : 1. No other metabolites were found in measurable amounts. The pyrophosphatase splitting UDPglucuronic acid showed a pH optimum at 8.9, but the liberation of D-glucuronic acid from UDPglucuronic acid had two pH maxima (pH 3.5 and 8.5). EDTA appeared to be less powerful inhibitor of pyrophosphatase than previously suggested. About 25 per cent of the UDPglucuronic acid hydrolyzing activity was still remaining in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone was found to have a slight inhibitory action on the pyrophosphatase activity. Citrate inhibited powerfully the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid and the liberation of free D-glucuronic acid. Phosphate was also inhibitory. 3. In the presence of an exogenous UDPglucuronosyltransferase substrate, 4-nitrophenol, the formation of D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and free D-glucuronic acid were slightly reduced, and D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, 4-nitrophenylglucuronide and free D-glucuronic acid were produced in ratio 78 : 23 : 1. When 10 mM EDTA was added to diminish the hydrolytic consumption of the glucuronyl donor substrate, the corresponding ratio was still as unfavorable as 19 : 2.6 : 1. The measurable activity of UDPglucuronosyltransferase was lower in the presence of phosphate or citrate than in Tris-HCl buffer, although they protected the glucuronyl donor substrate against hydrolysis. 4. The results indicate that even in the presence of added glucuronyl acceptor substrate the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid predominates the conjugation in rat liver microsomes. The rate of the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid is quite considerable even in the presence of EDTA, and it is recommended to control the UDPglucuronic acid pyrophosphatase activity when UDPglucuronosyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions are studied. Free D-glucuronic acid appears to be produced from UDPglucuronic acid for further use via D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, the rate-limiting step being the hydrolysis of this intermediate. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, glucuronides of either endogenous or exogenous aglycones and beta-glucuronidase have only a minor role in this respect in rat liver microsomes.',\n",

Oxygen affinity of haemoglobin, measured as P50 act pH, was unchanged in ketoacidosis compared to the time, however, P50 act pH fell striking (p less than 0.001) and remained decreased up to 7 days depending upon the resynthesis of 2,3-DPG in relation to Pi.

There was a close association of n with 2,3-DPG (p less than 0.001) and additionally with Pi at 2,3-DPG-levels below 10 mumoles/g Hb. Based on these findings a decreased erythrocyte oxygen release of one fifth during acidosis and more than one third after pH-correction can be hypothesised.

Acid outputs from HP were determined by an intragastric titration method when amino acid solutions were perfused into HP at various concentrations, pH values, and distention pressures. Only L-isomers of all natural amino acids were found to stimulate acid secretion, whereas D-isomers of amino acids tested were completely inert in this respect. The comparison of the secretagogue activity of amino acids shows that L-histidine among essential amino acids and glycine among nonessential amino acids exhibited the strongest stimulation of acid outputs, reaching, respectively, 52 and 40% of the maximal response to histamine. Decreasing the pH of L-histidine solution perfused into HP in sequential order from 5.0 to 1.0 resulted in a stepwise reduction of acid output, falling at pH 1.0 to about 40% of the peak response achieved at pH 5.0. Local irrigation of HP by 2% xylocaine and intravenous infusion of atropine (100 mug per kg per hr) or metiamide (2.9 mg per kg per hr) reduced but did not abolish HP response to chemical stimulation and the pH dependency of this response. We conclude that only L- and not D-isomers of amino acids bathing the oxyntic gland area stimulate acid secretion by a local, gastrin-independent mechanism sensitive to distention pressure and pH.',\n",

Each of the four strains showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the merodiploidy. Complementary strands of DNA's from these stable and unstable strains were resolved and homoduplex and heteroduplex hybrids made from the separated DNA strands were used as donors in genetic transformations. Activities of a normal marker (streptomycin resistance) and those involved in the heterozygosity (c, d and d+) were quantitatively measured. From those heteroduplexes made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable strain, the normal marker is transferred efficiently, but the heterozygous markers are not. On the other hand, if both strands of a heteroduplex are derived from different heterozygotic strains, all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain. The lowered efficiency in the former type of heteroduplex is attributed to an inhomology resulting from a tandem duplication in the merodiploid strains, and a postulated DNA repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex. The inhomology probably includes (a) a microheterogeneity between the c site and the wild type locus, and (b) a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites. The first of these inhomologies produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d allele associated with the mutant c marker, and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native merodiploid DNA's.\",\n",

The physical properties of the native and denatured DNA from the heterozygotes and the nonheterozygous strains were not distinguishable. The denaturability and the renaturability of biological activity for the heterozygous markers were essentially identical to those of the normal markers. The heterozygosity extends to the closely linked locus giving rise to four different configurations of cd and cd+ transformants, characterized by their frequencies of segregation and donor-marker activities. The marker-activity ratios and the frequency of co-transfer of heterozygous markers were found to remain the same in each when the donor DNA was native, denatured or reannealed without fractionation or reannealed after remixing of resolved strands. Possible models were weighed against these observations and these considerations led to the suggestion that tandem duplication of a gene region may be responsible for the heterozygosity and instability of this region.

The str-r mutations in the two species had been previously shown to be allelic. Homology of the thy- mutations in the two species was demonstrated in the similar phenotypic properties they conferred (death in the absence of thymidine, lack of thymidylate synthetase). The str and thy loci are unlinked in each species.--- When the two species are transformed by both homospecific and heterospecific DNA, the efficiency is always lower in the heterospecific cross. The efficiency of heterospecific transformation is considerably lower at the thy than at the str locus. DNA was extracted from recipients that had integrated markers of heterospecific origin. When such hybrid DNA is tested on the original recipient species, the heterospecific markers are usually as efficient as homospecific markers. When tested on the original donor species, however, the hybrid DNA is usually more efficient than heterospecific DNA. This is true for both thy and str transformation. -- -- Forty independent thy+ hybrids were obtained in the cross of sanguis thy- recipients with pneumoniae thy+ DNA. These hybrids fall into a number of classes based upon the relative efficiency with which their extracted DNA's are able to transfer the thy+ marker into pneumoniae thy- cells. The most efficient of these DNA's exhibits about 20% of the efficiency of homospecific pneumoniae thy+ DNA and three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than heterospecific sanguis thy+ DNA. Thus, very little of the inefficiency of heterospecific transformation of the thy locus is ascribable to a classic restriction mechanism. Rather, the wild-type thy+ loci in the two species appear to differ at multiple sites, and independent heterospecific transfers result in differential extents of integration of these sites. On this basis, the thy+ loci of the two species differ at a greater number of sites than do the respective str+ loci.\",\n",

The isolated type III collagen contained mainly gamma and higher molecular weight components cross-linked by reducible and/or non-reducible bonds. The isolated alpha1 (III) chains had an amino acid composition characteristic of type III collagen. Denatured but unreduced type III collagen, chromatographed on carboxymethyl-cellulose, eluted in the alpha 2 region, while after reduction and alkylation the alpha1 (III) chains eluted between the positions of alpha1 (I) and alpha2. The mid-point melting temperature temperature (tm) of type III collagen (35.1 degrees C) in a citrate buffer at pH 3.7 was somewhat lower than that of type I collagen (35.9 degrees C).

       "  'abstract': 'The antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SS-II) was significantly increased in mice treated with antilymphocyte serum (ALS). BALG/c mice given 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1 relative to the days of immunization with 0.5 mug of SSS-II had a 20-fold increment (11,383 increased to 199,917) in the number of splenic plaque-forming cells enumerated on day 5 compared with untreated, immunized controls. This effect has been attributed to the elimination of subpopulation of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) that has suppressor function. The present series of experiments relate the augmented antibody response to SSS-II in mice treated with ALS to increased host resistance after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, type III (Pn-II). The 50%  lethal dose of Pn-III in niminnunized mice was 102 and the 100% lethal dose was 103 organisms. Mice immunized with 0.5 mug of SSS-III and challenged 5 days later with Pn-III were completely protected against a dose of up to 108 organisms. Mice treated with 0.25 ml of ALS on days -1, 0, and 1, immunized with SSS-III on day 0, and challenged with 2.5 X 10(9) Pn-III on day 5 had a mean survival time of greater than 100 h compared with 16 h for immunized non-serum-treated controls. Animals given a single injection of ALS before immunization showed no increase in resistance, whereas mice treated after immunization had significant prolongation of survival times. Untreated, immunized mice challenged with 5 X 10(9), 1 X 5 X 10(8) Pn-II survived 14 to 19 h, whereas ALS-treated animals had mean survival times of 48, 174, and 222 h, respectively. These findings suggest that immunoregulatory T cells may have a biologically significant effect in a narrow zone in which the normal host immune response is insufficient but still potentially capable of providing some additional degree of protection if suppressor cells are elimated.',\n",

A long-ranging consequence of this changed concept is a well-founded modification of therapy. The most important discovery was, that in a well balanced glucose electrolyte solution sodium and glucose enhance their absorption mutually and increase the absorption of water by solvent drag. Since in most acute diarrheas the mechanisms of absorption of glucose and electrolytes are retained this mechanism can be utilized for fast oral rehydration and reinstitution of normal intestinal homeostasis. Prompt institution of a diet consisting of the previously mentioned glucose-electrolyte solution usually prevents severe dehydration and the need for stationary treatment. The elimination of lactose and long chain fatty acids from the diet prevents continuation of the pathologic osmotic and chemical conditions in the intestine. Antibiotics are not indicated in acute diarrhea with the exception of diarrhea caused by enteroinvasive E. Coli or Shigella, in the case of Salmonella-gastroenteritis even contraindicated. Further research concentrates on the development of drugs for neutralisation of E. Coli enterotoxin and the prevention of diarrheas by development of effective vaccines.',\n",

In fact, however, the Plan of Action passed by the Conference contains very little relating to population and family planning. Instead, the document is dominated by wordy phrases about the necessity of attaining social and economic development in those countries. Will the insight that family planning programs work efficiently only if they are an integral part of programs for the social and economic development of a country lead to such programs being realized? There is every reason to doubt that the plan of Action will have any such effect. The reasons for the underdevelopment of Third World countries cannot be removed through such United Nations resolutions. In the People's Republic of China, family planning is widely accepted, especially in the towns, and now also among the rural population. Limiting the number of children is considered part of China's development effort. China is a less-developed country that is in the process of rapid social and economic development. The issue at stake in other Third World countries is how to achieve a similar development. As soon as this goal is achieved, family planning efforts are meaningful and have a chance of success. The experience of China demonstrates that even there it took time before the efforts succeeded. There are many Third World countries that could, without much difficulty, support a population considerably larger than the present one. But there are no doubt also a number of countries where the population is already so large that a continued population increase would be harmful. The need to achieve rapid development becomes increasingly urgent, not in the least to make it possible to attain a reduced population growth. The sad truth is that so little development takes place in those countries. Without social and economic development, the present rapid population increase will continue in those countries where there is already an overly dense population.\",\n",

Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists (alpha-antagonists, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine; beta-antagonists, propranolol and sotalol) cuased a dose-dependent reduction in intraocular pressure and blood pressure and increased total outflow facility. The results are consistent with the concept that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the anterior uvea and that vasomotor tone is essential to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure. No antagonist reduced the PG-induced elevation of intraocular pressure unless the blood pressure was severely lowered. All antagonists inhibit the normal PG-induced increase in total outflow facility, indicating that these agents protect the blood-aqueous barrier from breakdown without altering the vasodilatory response to PG. All antagonists reduced the fall in intraocular pressure produced by THC by approximately 50 per cent, except for sotalol which completely abolished the intraocular pressure fall. Only the alpha-adrenergic antagonists prevented the THC-induced increase in total outflow facility. The results indicate that true outflow facility may well be regulated exclusively by alpha-receptors. The data are consistent with the effect of THC being primarily a vasodilation of the efferent blood vessels of the anterior uvea. The partial inhibition by alpha-adrenergic antagonists may also suggest a lesser role of THC on the afferent vessels.',\n",

Viability was measured by slide cultures and plate counts. The survival of cell suspensions equivalent to 1 to 10 mg (dry wt)/ml was influenced by cryptic growth. The rate of cryptic growth, assessed by plate counts, increased with cell density and could not be alleviated by starvation with dialysis. Dialysis of the starving culture did retard the onset of cryptic growth but did not eliminate it, indicating that the major substrates for regrowth were relatively large cellular components. In phosphate buffer, 6.7 homologous heat-killed cells allowed for the doubling of one S. enteritidis cell. Cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to 20 mug (dry wt)/ml (105 cells/ml). Similar half-life survival times were calculated for both these populations, but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly. These differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation. The half-life survival time of S. enteritidis starved at 20 mug (dry wt)/ml was 140 h in phosphate buffer, 82 h in 3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,-6-tetrahydrophthalic acid buffer, and 77 h in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer.',\n",

Experiments reported here were directed at asking whether hex-dependent marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In the absence of intracellular competition for hex function, there was no detectable effect of DNA size on hex-dependent marker efficiency as donor DNA was sheared from greater than 1 x 107 daltons to 3.6 x 105 daltons. The latter DNA was purified by two successive velocity fractionations to ensure that the activity seen was representative of DNA of that size. Quantitative examination of the system shows that, for the lethal event hypothesis to be true, the excision step has to remove an average of 7,000 to 10,000 nucleotides. This figure is so much greater than that seen in other excision processes that alternate hypotheses should be considered. The presently known properties of the hex system can be accounted for by a model invoking the migratory features of type I restriction enzymes.',\n",

Thiotryptophan [beta-(1-benzo-thien-3-yl)-alanine] is rather ineffective in the end product regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis, whereas tryptophan and 5-methyltryptophan are potent effectors. The presence of increased levels of DMAT synthetase in ergot cultures supplemented with tryptophan or thiotryptophan, and to a lesser extent with 5-methyltryptophan, suggests that the induction effect involves de novo synthesis of the enzyme.

The enzyme readily aggregates to form, apparently inactive, higher molecular weight oligomers. The very rapid loss of enzyme activity during the assay was analyzed extensively. It was found to be due to inactivation of the enzyme by the substrate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, and unrelated to enzyme turnover or oxidation of bound iron. The loss of activity was shown to be a first order decay process, and methods are given for obtaining accurate initial reaction rates under all conditions. Evidence was presented that the enzyme assumes a catalytically inactive conformation at pH 3.4, which only relatively slowly rearranges to an active form at pH 6.5; the rearrangement can be blocked by the presence of substrate. We have found that Fe2+, which is required for enzymatic activity, can equilibrate freely, albeit slowly, with the enzyme during the course of the enzyme reaction even in the presence of saturating 3-hydroxanthranilate. Under assay conditons, the Fe2+ has an apparent dissociation constant of 0.04 mM. The kinetic properties of the enzyme were found to be dramatically different in beta,beta-dimethylglutarate buffer and collidine buffer; both the rate of loss of activity during the assay and the substrate Km and Vmax were affected.',\n",

Colipase alone or with bile salt caused only a slight perturbation of these values. At low concentrations, 0 to 0.3mM, taurodeoxycholate increases the stability of lipase by 5-fold. At higher concentrations, 0.3 to 0.8 mM, but still below its critical micelle concentration, taurodeoxycholate prevents the adsorption of lipase to the bead-water interface. This appears to be the major mechanism by which this bile salt inhibits lipolysis. Colipase exerts small positive effects on lipase stability and catalytic activity.

The transport of nucleotides was measured by membrane filtration assays; the assay was shown not to harm the relatively labile rickettsiae. The nucleotide transport system was shown to reside in the rickettsiae, not in the contaminating yolk sac mitochondria of the preparation. The influx of nucleotide had an activation energy of 12 to 13 kcal above 22 deg-rees (an apparent transition temperature), and 30 kcal below this value. The uptake of nucleotide was independent of the Mg2+ concentration, but was markedly stimulated by the phosphate concentration. The pH optimum of the influx of nucleotide was pH 7. The specificity of the transport system was remarkable in that it required a specific moiety in each portion of the nucleotide, i.e. an adenine base, a ribose sugar, and two or three, but not one, phosphates. Of the wide variety of compounds tested, the system could transport only ADP, ATP, and (beta, gamma-methylene) adenosine 5\\'-triphosphate. The influx of nucleotide was a saturable process; half-maximum velocity was achieved at a nucleotide concentration of about 75 muM. ADP and ATP were competitive inhibitors of each other\\'s transport. Although at least 95% of the labeled intracellular nucleotide was exchangeable, efflux of labeled nucleotide was observed only in the presence of unlabeled nucleotide in the medium. Half-maximum efflux was achieved at a concentration of about 75 muM. A large intracellular to extracellular concentration gradient of labeled nucleotide was maintained in the presence of metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers, which completely abolished rickettsial hemolysis. While having no effect on the steady state, KCN and DNP accelerated both influx and efflux. Measurements of the endogenous pool of adenine nucleotides in isolated rickettsiae show that is was large (5 mM), and that these unlabeled nucleotides exchanged, on approximately a 1/1 basis, with exogenously added nucleotide. These studies support the proposal that rickettsiae are not \"leaky\" to adenine nucleotides or to small molecules in general, and that they have a carrier-mediated transport system which allows an exchange of host and parasite ADP and ATP.',\n",

The pH dependence of the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-induced difference spectrum can be accounted for quantitatively by a 5% shift toward higher spin of the aquo form of methemoglobin, a 15% shift toward higher spin of the hydroxide form, and a shift in the apparent pKa for the water to hydroxide transition from 7.92 to 8.04 when mercurial is bound. The rate of these heme abosrbance changes is consistent with the rapid second order formation of the beta93 cysteine, mercury-mercaptide bond and does not represent a change due to the dissociation of methemoglobin tetramers into dimers, even though the latter, slow process does follow mercurial binding.

The more rapid absorbance change is too fast to be measured by stopped flow techniques, whereas the slow change exhibits a half-time in the range 1 to 6 s. From the pH dependence of the rapidly formed difference spectrum and from a series of heme ligand binding studies, the rapid phase is interpreted to reflect a localized tertiary conformational change which immediately accompanies inositol hexaphosphate binding and results in a selective increase in spin and reactivity of the beta chain heme groups. In contrast, the slow phase appears to reflect a first order isomerization process which involves only a small portion (less than 10%) of the hemoglobin molecules and results primarily in a marked alteration of the spectral properties of the alpha chains with little change in spin. While the rapid spectral transition cannot be directly related to the overall quaternary transition which occurs during oxygen binding to ferrous deoxyhemoglobin, the slow spectral transition may represent the abortive formation of a deoxyhemoglobin A-like conformation which is inhibited in both rate and extent by the presence of water molecules bound to the heme iron atoms.',\n",

Reaction mixtures consist of equal concentrations of monomer and dimer at a total protein concentration as high as 1.4 mug/ml, and at 1 ng/ml, monomer accounts for greater than 99% of the total.

In addition, derivatives containing specifically carbamylated NH2-terinal groups in alpha or beta chains, or both, were prepared by treatment with cyanate, and equilibrated likewise to allow the identification of specific resonances observed by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. In deoxyhemoglobin, a resonanance at 29.2 ppm upfield of external CS2 was assigned to the alpha chain terminal adduct, and one at 29.8 ppm to the beta chain terminal adduct. In the liganded state as the CO derivative, the terminal adduct on both chains showed a common resonance position at 29.8 ppm. Small effects of pH on the resonance positions were observed. Under certain conditions, a resonance was observed at 33.4 ppm, probably not ascribable to a carbamino compound. A carbamino resonance that became prominent at higher pH was found at 28.4 ppm, and is tentatively ascribed to one or more adducts on epsilon amino groups. The beta chain resonances in particular are minimized by the presence of inositol hexaphosphate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Quantitative analysis of the resonance intensities shows that the effects of conversion from the deoxy to the liganded state in reducing the degree of carbamino adduct is much more pronounced for the beta than for the alpha chains.',\n",

Papaverine, theophylline, and protaglandin E1, drugs known to maintain high intracellular levels of cAMP, had little effect on serum stimulated phosphate uptake. The phosphate uptake stimulating factor(s) in serum could be distinguised from the 3T3 cell survival and migration factors by stability characteristics, but this factor(s) could not be completely separated from a uridine uptake stimulation activity or growth promoting activity using a variety of serum fractionation procedures. Only partial stimulation of the uptake process was achieved with any one serum fraction indicating a multiplicity of serum components is probably involved in this process.

       "  'abstract': 'A technique for the selective extraction of 3-O-methyldopamine, normetanephrine and metanephrine from a single urine sample has been investigated. After hydrolysis of the conjugates, the diluted mixture is passed through a Dowex 50W-X2 column and the methoxylated amines are eluted by means of concentrated ammonia. The eluate, containing metanephrine, normetanephrine and 3-O-methyldopamine is evaporated, and a solution of the residue in borate buffer is fractionated under strictly controlled conditions on an Amberlite CG-50 column. The three amines so separated are estimated by specific fluorimetric methods. The extraction recovery is 80 +/- 3% for pure solutions and 78 +/- 4% for 3-O-methyldopamine added to urine. The fluorimetric procedure, carried out under well-defined conditions, allows the estimation of 10 ng of 3-O-methethyldopamine. The spectral characteristics of the fluorescent derivative are similar to those obtained with dopamine, so that it can be assumed that iodine oxidation of 3-O-methyldopamine demethylates this compound and oxidises the resulting dopamine to the dopamine fluorophore (5,6-dihydroxy-indole). Of the compounds that might interfere in the fluorimetric procedure, dopamine, DOPA and alpha-methyl-DOPA are destroyed by the ammoniacal elution from the Dowex column and 3-O-methyl-DOPA is eliminated in the effluent from the Amberlite column. The elimination of interfering compounds and the improved separation on Amberlite ensure high specificity for this procedure. We have applied the method to normal urine and to pathological urines from patients with adrenergic tumours or untreated and treated parkinsonian subjects; vital information has been obtained on the prognosis of adrenergic tumours. The presence of large amounts of dopamine, normetanephrine and/or metanephrine does not affect the assay for 3-O-methyldopamine. The method is also applicable to rat and dog urine, and can be applied to tissue extracts with little modification.',\n",

Because they were more stable and were more immunoreactive than the other products, band I and band IIa from the latter system were used separately as tracers with Niswender antiserum R-42 in radioimmunoassays for GnRH. The standard curves of each tracer are distinct: when analyzed after log-logit transformation, the band I curve had a mean slope of -3.31 +/- 0.2 (SE) and a 50% B/Bt level of 9 +/- 0.8 pg (n=8) of synthetic GnRH, whereas the band IIa standard curve had a slope of -2.30 +/- 0.6 and a 50% B/Bt value of 20 +/- 0.9 pg (n=11). The sensitivity of both assays is approximately 2.0 pg. Gn RH concentrations in plasma and serum samples assayed with band I were consistently greater than those assayed with band IIa. Normal adult male plasmas assayed with band I measured 21 +/- 0.9 pg/ml, whereas band IIa values were 8 +/- 0.4 pg/ml. No difference between plasma and serum was detected, nor was there any difference among adult men, adult women, prepubertal children, hypogonadal patients, or hypopituitary patients with either assay. Plasma GnRH concentrations were also similar in jugular and vena cava samples from intact and castrated male rats. Because many of the samples were at or below the sensitivity of the band IIa assay, they were concentrated after extraction with either methanol or acid-ethanol. However, endogenous immunoreactive GnRH could not be concentrated by these extraction procedures. As measured in the band IIa assay, hypothalamic extracts from control adult male rats contained 3.1 +/- 0.4 ng while hypothalami from castrated rats contained 1.4 +/- 0.1 ng. Similar but slightly lower values were obtained with band I. In contrast, the GnRH content of pineal glands from intact and castrated male rats was similar (approximately 150 pg) when determined in either assay. These studies emphasize that: 1) the characteristics of the radioiodinated hormone can influence the quantitation of GnRH; and 2) endogenous plasma concentrations of GnRH are much lower than previously reported.',\n",

Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli.\",\n",

By contrast, serum antibody levels, which were measured in the same mice using a Farr test, reached peak values 5 days after immunization and then declined much more slowly than did the number of PFC. Two factors were found to contribute to this disparity. First, experiments conducted with splenectomized mice showed that extrasplenic antibody synthesis, which began between days 3 and 4 after immunization and peaked on days 6 to 7, accounted for nearly one-third of the total amount of serum antibody produced. Second, the average rate of antibody synthesis by PFC increased through day 6 after immunization and then declined. Antigen-antibody dissociation tests showed that the avidity of the serum antibody obtained 4 to 7 days after immunization was the same. Moreover, during the same interval, all the antibody detected by the Farr test was of the IgM class. Thus, a change in avidity or class of immunoglobulin after day 5 did not account for the disparity observed. The clearance rate of antibody injected i.v. into nonimmune and immunized mice was studied.

Two different techniques were used to isolate epidermis and similar results were obtained with both. However, the technique of isolating epidermis using a mild heat treatment required that the temperature be maintained at 52 degrees C for 30 sec. If the temperature was raised to 54 degrees C or above, there was a large reduction in the AHH activity. Isolated epidermis has 4 to 5 times the AHH activity as dermis and about twice that of whole skin.

A unique primary structure and a multiplicity of post-translational modification reactions are required for normal fibrillogenesis. The post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding of the molecule into triple-helical conformation, proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen, and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. Any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease. Recently, defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue. Thus far, the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include lysyl hydroxylase deficiency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI, p-collagen peptidase deficency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII, decreased synthesis of type III collagen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, lysyl oxidase deficency in S-linked cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type V, and decreased synthesis of type I collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta.',\n",

Serum of patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema having no functional C1-esterase inhibitor was as effective in inhibiting the proteolysis as normal serum. The inhibitor was localized in 4S fractions of normal serum fractionated on Sephadex G-200. Fractionation of normal serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 filtration, and CM-Sephadex chromatography did not result in appearance of inhibitory activity in more than one protein peak, suggesting the possibility that only one inhibitor might be responsible. Since all fractions which contained the inhibitor of proteolysis also contained alpha1-antitrypsin, since sera of patients having low alpha1-antitrypsin levels contained less inhibitory activity, and since antibodies against alpha1-antitrypsin reversed the inhibition obtained from normal serum, the inhibition of proteolysis may be attributed to alpha1-antitrypsin.',\n",

Such milk makes it possible to ignore endogenous serum folate binder, since crude (but not purified) milk contains a factor which releases folate from serum binder. It simplifies counting radioactivity by employing a gamma emitting isotope of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA), namely the 125I-tyramide of PGA. Like the 3H-PGA assay of Givas and Gutcho, it permits the use of stable PGA rather than unstable methyltetrahydrofolic acid (MeTHFA) standards, because it is carried out at pH 9.3, a pH at which milk folate binder is unable to distinguish PGA from MeTHFA, which is the predominat folate in human tissues. The equipment required to do the radioassay is present in most diagnostic chemistry laboratories. Results are essentially identical to the generally accepted Lactobacillus casel microbiologic method of folate assay, except that false low results are not produced in the radioassay by antibiotics, tranquilizers, and chemotherapeutic agents. Three caveats in its use are the relative instability of 125I-PGA as compared to 3H-PGA, the fact that various powdered milks differ widely in folate-binding capacity, and that only about 60 per cent of commercially obtained skim or powdered milk preparations appear to contain the substance which splits folate from serum binder.',\n",

The binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with 125iodine, and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns. The peptide-binding macromolecules from several patients were compared. They showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the des-aspartyl1-angiotensin sequence. The plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum pH and their mobility in electrophoretic fields. Those with more acid pH optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility. The binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight, approximately 140,000 and 250,000. Those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human IgA. Kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for (des-asp1)-angiotensin, with apparent association constants ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) M-1. Binding activity was labile to heat, and to treatment with pepsin or trypsin. It was inhibited by calcium, protamine, streptomycin, and some other cationic compounds. The plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble angiotensin-binding molecules extracted from tissues, and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin.

Exposure of the axon to 5% CO2 at constant external pH caused a sharp decrease in pHi, while the subsequent removal of the gas caused pHi to overshoot its initial value. If the exposure to CO2 was prolonged, two additional effects were noted: (a) during the exposure, the rapid initial fall in pHi was followed by a slow rise, and (b) after the exposure, the overshoot was greatly exaggerated. Application of external NH4Cl caused pHi to rise sharply; return to normal ASW caused pHi to return to a value below its initial one. If the exposure to NH4Cl was prolonged, two additional effects were noted: (a) during the exposure, the rapid initial rise in pHi was followed by a slow fall, and (b) after the exposure, the undershoot was greatly exaggerated. Exposure to several weak acid metabolic inhibitors caused a fall in pHi whose reversibility depended upon length of exposure. Inverting the electrochemical gradient for H+ with 100 mM K-ASW had no effect on pHi changes resulting from short-term exposure to azide. A mathematical model explains the pHi changes caused by NH4Cl on the basis of passive movements of both NH3 and NH4+.

The hnc-1 marker cotransduced with group IV genes at 97 to 100 % and not at all with group I, which is known to be the structural gene for HDH. The data obtained in the studies of Km (histidinol) and Km (NAD), and the effect of pH and temperature on the HDH activity from PAO1 and PAO14 are in full agreement with the genetic data that the hnc-1 mutation is not in the structural gene for HDH. It is suggested that hnc-1 may be a mutation in a regulatory gene affecting HDH synthesis in PAO14 and may map close to his-IV whose function in histidine biosynthesis is not known.',\n",

The stimulant is a component of the host's diet. The vegetative stage of N. frontalis bears a strong morphological resemblance to that of certain species of aquatic phycomycete fungi, and consists of a reproductive body borne on  a single, much branched rhizoid. The flagellates liberated in vivo within 15 to 45 min of feeding lose their motility within I h and develop into the vegetative phase, thus producing a rapid decrease in population density of the flagellates. Conditions for maximum flagellate production are similar to those occurring in the rumen: pH 6-5, 39 degrees C, absence of O2, presence of CO2. Differentiation of the reproductive body is inhibited by compounds affecting membrane structure and function, but not by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The organism was cultured in vitro in an undefined medium in the absence of bacteria or other flagellates.\",\n",

Aphids without claws were able to transmit the virus. Transmission thus seems similar to that of nonpersistent viruses. The ratio of virus to polyamino acid, as well as the KCl concentration, markedly affected transmission. Transmission was best from mixtures which contained 250 mug/ml TMV, 2-5 MUG/ML PLO (mol. wt. 120000) and 0-6 M-KCl. A similar mixture favoured transmission when poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 85000) was substituted for PLO, but with poly-L-lysine (mol. wt. 30 000) it was necessary to decrease the KCl to 0-3 M to obtain transmission. Less KCl (0-08 to 0-24 M) also favoured aphid transmission of PLO-treated potato virus X and tobacco rattle virus. PLO-treated TMV ultracentrifuged in the presence of, and resuspended in, 0-6 M-KCl remained aphid  transmissible while PLO-treated virus in 2 M-DCl, which favours greater dissociation of the virus-PLO complex, was transmissible neither before nor after sedimentation by ultracentrifuging, and resuspension in 0-6 M-KCl. these results show that transmissibility is not due to a permanent alteration of the virus by PLO and indicate that the formation of a TMV-PLO complex is required for transmission. Sequential acquisition experiments suggest that PLO may act by binding TMV to receptor sites in aphids. However, the possibility that PLO affects the infection process was not ruled out.',\n",

Using this substrate, and determining the acetic acid liberated by gas-liquid chromatogrphy, a method for the estimation of Vi phage deacetylase activity has been developed. Purified particles of Vi phage III were exposed to a variety of mildly dissociative reagents and conditions, and then tested for plaque-forming and for deacetylase activity. They have also been inspected under the electron microscope. Osmotic shock, and incubation in the presence of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (greater than or equil 0-01 M), or of L-arginine (0-25 M), were found to cause disintegration of the virions into empty head capsids, deoxyribonucleic acid, and base plates still carrying the spikes. The mixtures of viral fragments exhibited an increased deacetylase activity.

An increase in the monolayer surface pressure was noted for monolayers spread on the antihistamine solutions, suggesting penetration of the film by drug molecules. At high surface pressures there was an apparent ejection of drug molecules from the film. The ability of the antihistamines to increase surface pressure was correlated with their surface activity at the air-solution interface. The effect of drug concentration on the magnitude of the surface pressure was examined for diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Application of the Gibbs adsorption equation at low surface compressions indicated an approximate area per molecule for diphenhydramine in the film which was in good agreement with the value previously obtained at the air-solution interface. Preliminary measurements showed that the surface pressure increase was larger in the presence of phosphate buffer at pH 6-8. It was not clear whether this effect was caused by the buffer components or was a pH effect.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The binding of chloramphenicol to an albumin-lecithin complex in the presence or absence of premicellar concentrations of both ionic and non-ionic surfactants has been examined. Long chain, strong ionic detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulphate or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, severely perturb protein structure and eventually allow full separation of the complex into lecithin and albumin-detergent complexes. The dissociation process is reversible upon the removal of the detergent by exhaustive dialysis. After the splitting of the complex, the amount of antibiotic associated with the lipid-protein mixture increases. Structural alteration of the albumin-lecithin complex and the increase in the binding of chloramphenicol have an effect on the transfer rate of this antibiotic across an artificial barrier consisting of an aqueous dispersion of the same complex, as observed in a model system. It is suggested that a reversible alteration in membrane structure, and consequently in membrane permeability, might be easily effected, at the molecular level, through a reversible dissociation of structural lipoproteins into their components, operated by premicellar concentrations of ionic surfactants. This represents a tentative picture of the possible events taking place within the membrane and modifying the absorption rate of a drug, when it is associated with surfactants in a pharmaceutical preparation.',\n",

Hearts were removed from animals under light ether anaesthesia, transferred to a modified Langendorff perfusing apparatus and perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution at a rate of 5 ml min-1. The effect of pancuronium on the uptake of noradrenaline was determined by perfusing hearts for 5 min with perfusate containing various concentrations of pancuronium and 200 ng ml-1 of 14C-NA. After 5 min pancuronium-treated hearts contained less 14C-NA. The degree of reduced uptake increased with increasing concentrations of pancuronium. In addition, the combination of pancuronium perfusion and electrical stimulation (15 mA for 10 ms at 4 Hz) blocked the 50 min uptake of 14C-NA by the heart to a greater degree than either factor separately. The release of noradrenaline was determined after perfusing hearts with 14C-NA followed by perfusion with solution containing pancuronium but no 14C-NA for 1 h. Pancuronium infusion did not significantly alter the release of 14C-NA from the heart after 1 h of perfusion. The infusion of pancuronium caused a reduction in both the rate and strength of myocardial contraction of the isolated heart which was reversed by perfusion with perfusate free of pancuronium. Following perfusion with pancurnium the rate and strength of contraction of the heart was seen to \"rebound\" above pre-pancuronium values for a short period. The rebound of myocardial rate and contraction may have been due to the presence of myocardial noradrenaline previously blocked from reuptake by pancuronium since hearts removed from reserpinized animals did not demonstrate \"rebound.\"',\n",

In its simplest embodiment, the system is constructed by coating an osmotically activie solid agent with the rate-controlling, semipermeable membrane. This membrane contains an orifice of critical size through which solubilized agent is dispensed. The system can contain the agent in solid form at loading higher than 90% of the total volume, and the agent can be delivered at rates several orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved by solution diffusion through polymeric membranes. The delivery rate, the fraction of total content delivered at zero order, and the system's delivery portal size have been calculated for delivery of a single compound. Experimental work verified the theory. The release rate from the system was found to be independent of outside agitation when the system is not deformed by shaking action, the pH of the environment, and delivery portal size for sizes within a specified range.

Increases in blood pressure in response to stimulation of the sympathetic vasomotor outflow in the pithed rat preparation were markedly and permanently reduced in guanethidine-treated animals. Isolated intestinal nerve-muscle preparations from guanethidine-treated animals usually contracted in response to nerve stimulation, rather than relaxing as in controls. The response to stimulation of the hypogastric nerve in vas deferens preparations was reduced 1 month after cessation of treatment. The responses of the vas deferens from guanethidine-treated and control animals were the same 7 months after treatment despite a 93% reduction in norepinephrine concentration.

When applied either externally or internally, quinidine HCl suppresses both sodium and potassium conductance increases, the effect on the former accounting for the observed decrease in action potential. The potassium conductance in quinidine undergoes a marked inactivation in a manner dependent upon the membrane potential and time, accounting for the observed prolongation of the terminal falling phase of the action potential. Quinidine methiodide exhibits the effect similar to that of quinidine HCl only when applied internally. The dissociation constants of quinidine in suppressing the sodium conducting system are estimated to be 2.4 x 10(-4) and 4.0 x 10(-4) M for quinidine HCl and methiodide, respectively. The dissociation constant of quinidine in suppressing the potassium-conducting system decreases with increasing step depolarization. When applied externally to the intact axons, quinidine HCl is more effective at external pH 8.6 than at 7.3. When perfused internally, quinidine HCl is more effective at internal pH 7.0 than at 8.0, and the potency is related to the calculated internal concentration of the charged form rather than that of the uncharged form.

       "  'abstract': 'The effects of two barbiturates on calcium uptake by sympathetic ganglia have been examined. Sodium pentobarbital (0.4-0.75 mM) and sodium thiopental (0.3 mM) block the preganglionic stimulation-induced uptake of 45Ca by rat superior cervical ganglia but not action potential conduction in the presynaptic axons. The ganglionic-blocking agent, tetraethylammonium, does not inhibit stimulation-induced Ca uptake and does not prevent the blocking effect of thiopental. This effect is therefore probably presynaptic. Postassium-rich media also stimulate Ca uptake by the ganglia, and this effect is markedly inhibited by pentobarbital. Since the K stimulation effect is also observed in deafferented ganglia but not in guanethidine-denervated ganglia, this effect is probably associated primarily with postsynaptic elements. In sum, the data suggest that the barbiturates inhibit Ca permeability changes in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.',\n",

The muscle exhibited spontaneous action potentials which consisted of a spike-like potential which, after a brief and partial repolarization, was followed by a negative-going, plateau-type potential. In 97% of the preparations, no tension changes were produced by spontaneous action potentials. 3. Tetrodotoxin, atropine, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and H1 and H2 receptor blocking agents had no effect on the action potential. It was concluded that the action potential was myogenic in origin. 4. The mean frequency of the action potential at 37+/- 0.5 degrees C was 1.0/min+/-0.06 (s.e. of mean, n=92) and the mean duration 7.1+/-0.2 sec (s.e. of mean, n=11). 5. Steady depolarizing current increased whereas hyperpolarizing current decreased the frequency of the action potential. 6. Length-tension relations were studied. In twelve strips, the average resting, passive, tension at LO was 570 mg. The active force of isometric contraction produced by acetylcholine increased with strip length up to a maximum, then decreased wtih further increased in length. There were no mechanical responses to pentagastrin. 7. Pentagastrin had two sites of action. On smooth muscle, it increased the frequency of the action potential in a dose dependent fashion. Threshold concentraions ranged from 2X10-14 to 10-11M. The ED50 was 2X10-10M. The maximum response, 5.4/min, was reached at 10-8M. Pentagastrin also released acetylcholine from intramural cholinergic nerves. 8. Pentagastrin reduced the amplitude and duration of the action potential.',\n",

With low concentrations of CO2, the effect was dependent on the initial pH as predicted by the Law of Mass Action. During a long exposure to 2-65% CO2 at pH 7-5, the internal pH returned slowly to its previous value, suggesting active transport of H+ (or OH- or HCO3-) ions across the fibre membrane. 5.

The hydrolysis rates of phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine aziridinium ions (2a,b) in physiological medium were found to be 6.0 4 x 10(-4) and 8.35 x 10(-4) sec-1, respectively. The rates of cyclization of the parent amines to 2a and 2b in aqueous medium were 1.9 x 10(-2) and 7.2 x 10(-3) sec-1, respectively. The potencies and kinetic profiles indicate that the aziridinium ion is the only active species in alpha-adrenergic blockade. Moreover, differences in potency between phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine appear to be exclusively to a difference in receptor affinity rather than to a difference in intrinsic alkylating ability.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'One of the major diagenetic pathways of organic matter in recent sediments involves the condensation of cellular constituents, particularly amino acids and sugars, into insoluble melanoidin-type polymers. These polymers consist mainly of humic and fulvic acids and make up the major part of the organic carbon reservoir in recent sediments. We suggest that a similar set of reactions between abiotically formed amino acids and sugars, and more generally between aldehydes and amines, occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere. The rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the dissolved organic carbon from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an \"organic soup\". Melanoidin polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidation-reduction coenzymes: 1. they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases; 2. they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals; and 3. they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary enzymic redox processes. The prebiotic formation of similar polymers could, therefore, have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions. We suggest that the prebiotic scenario involved chemical and protoenzymic reactions at the sediment-ocean interface in relatively shallow waters and under conditions not much different from those of the recent environment.',\n",

A phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced. It is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates, a deoxy dimer, as seen in the lamprey, could have originated with a single amino acid substitution. The deoxy dimer has a Bohr effect, cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer. One, or two, additional amino acid substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric deoxy hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation. Gene duplication, giving incipient alpha and beta genes, probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric oxyhemoglobin. The origin of an organic phosphate binding site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one, or two, amino acid substitutions. ATP was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function. The binding of ATP by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of ATP in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of ATP synthesis. The switch from regulation of hemoglobin function by ATP to regulation by DPG may have been a consequence of the curtailment of oxidative phosphorylation in the red blood cell. The basic mechanisms by which ATP and DPG concentrations can respond to strss on the oxygen transport system were present before the origin of an organic phosphate binding site on hemoglobin. A switch from ATP regulation to IP5 regulation occurred in the common ancestor of birds.',\n",

The dog liver enzyme system displayed characteristics similar to those described for the rodent liver enzyme system in that enzyme activity was greatest in liver tissue, was localized in the microsomal subcellular fraction, required no cofactors, and was inhibited by heat, sodium fluoride, and thiol reagents. In five replicate assays, the relative rates of deacetylation were about 10, 6, and 1 with 4-acetylaminobiphenyl (84.8 +/- 12.4), 2-acetylaminofluorene (52.5 +/- 5.1), and 2-acetylaminonaphthalene (8.8 +/- 3.3), respectively. As a canine urinary bladder carcinogen, 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is considered more potent than 2-acetylaminofluroene, while 2-acetylaminonaphthalene is devoid of detectable carcinogenic activity, despite the fact that 2-aminoaphthalene is a well-established canine urinary bladder carcinogen. Removal of the acetyl group may be a requirement for urinary bladder carcinogenesis; accordingly, the present studies demonstrate the appearance of a direct relationship between dog liver deacetylase enzyme specificity and urinary bladder susceptibility to these carcinogenic arylacetamides.',\n",

Renal slice techniques were employed in these studies and were used to examine the effects of chromium on various renal transport processes. In addition, the accumulation of chromium by the renal tissue has also been studied. Marked accumulation by renal cortical slices of the rat was observed when 51Cr-labeled chromate or dichromate was added to the bathing solution. Some metabolic inhibitors interfered with this uptake process; in addition, some substrates metabolized by renal tissue reduced the accumulation of 51Cr. The use of [51Cr] dichromate and [51Cr]-chromate, as well as alterations in the bathing solution pH, indicated that in the rat chromium can interfere with renal transport processes, but that the oxidation state of this metal is not important. On the other hand, in the rabbit a greater interference with 51Cr uptake was noted at lower bathing solution pHs. This is interpreted to mean that chromate is the effective inhibitor in this species.',\n",

Thus moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the sarcotubular system. The absence of slow hyperpolarization in glycerol-treated fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase, and the sarcotubular system is responsible for the inward rectifier. Picrotoxin selectively inhibited both moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification and hyperpolarization-induced early conductance increase. This suggests that the same component in the sarcotubular system is responsible for these conductance changes. The inhibition with picrotoxin of moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an electrogenic effect rather than a decrease in K conductance.

It is suggested that, although the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration, the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range. The sarcolemmal conductance increase was rather insensitive to the change in pH of Ringer solution. It is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline pHs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of large parallel conductance. Apparent augmentation with EDTA of the sarcolemmal conductance increase infers that Ca ions affect the conductance increase.

Unlike other inotropic drugs, dopamine directly dilates the mesenteric, renal, and cerebral vessels and redirects blood flow to essential viscera. This dopaminergic effect is prominent with doses of 100-700 mug/min in adults and is attenuated by phenothiazines and haloperidol. At doses of 700-1400 mug/min, dopamine also has a significant beta-adrenergic, inotropic effect, increasing myocardial contractility. The inotropic effect is equivalent to that of isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, but tachycardia, tachyarrhythmias, and angina may be less frequent with dopamine. In doses greater than 1400 mug/min, dopamine is a vasoconstrictor with pressor effects usually equivalent to that of norepinephrine. Dopamine dilates pupils, does not dilate bronchi, and does not shunt blood from viscera to skeletal muscles as does isoproterenol.

The prevailing action of Nonachlasine on the blood supply and the function of the myocardium seems to be the result of several mechanisms: decreasing resistance of the coronaries due to the activation of the beta2-adrenergic structures; influence upon the extravascular factors of the regulation of the coronary circulation (changes in the metabolism and cardiac activity due to the excitation of the beta-adrenergic structures). The mechanism of the positive effect of Nonachlasine upon the blood supply and function of the heart is connected with its action on the adrenergic processes. The drug accumulates noradrenaline in the myocardium and increases the activity of phosphorilase-a. This coincides in time with the increased blood supply and contractile capacity of the heart. The beta-adrenoblocking agents prevent these effects.

Some mosquito species feed on a narrow range of vertebrates, some on a wide range, both influenced by host-availability and other environmental and behavioural factors. Only those which feed on maintenance hosts contribute to maintenance of the infection. Some species change their feeding pattern with season. The frequency of blood-feeding depends inter alia on environmental temperature. Longevity is perhaps most important: the majority of mosquitoes infected probably do not survive long enough to become infective; it is influenced by relative humidity, temperature and predation.

The particle is spherical, with a diameter of 38--39 nm. If the nucleocapsid is exposed to slightly acid pH (6.4--5.6) it undergoes a structural change and is contracted to a 32 nm state. A similar contraction can be effected by RNase treatment, in this case, however, in connection with a loss of RNA. Treatment of the nucleocapsid with 0.2 mM SDS results in dissociation of capsid protein from RNA, an effect which suggests strong RNA-protein interaction. At 0.05 mM SDS the protein remains associated with the RNA, but the S-value is reduced from 150 S to 100 S.

The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the rate of lipogenesis were shown to correlate to a certain extent when a reconstituted, cell free system consisting of 105,000 x g supernatant of rat liver and isolated mitochondria was used. This system was employed so that the role of the mitochondrion and pyruvate dehydrogenase in lipogenesis could be investigated. Dichloroacetate increased the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased the rate of lipogenesis, suggesting that the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is an important factor in determining the rate of lipogenesis in the reconstituted system. It was observed, however, that dichloroacetate was more effective in stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase than the rate of lipogenesis when mitochondria from starved animals were used to reconstitute lipogenesis. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratios and phosphorylation potentials (ATP/ADP x Pi) maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals were found to be significantly lower than those maintained by mitochondria isolated from chow fed animals. It is proposed that the lower \"energy pressure\" maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals severely limits lipogenesis at the ATP requiring steps of the process.',\n",

The optimum pH was between 7.0-7.5 for the mitochondrial fraction and between 6.5-8.0 for the cytosol fraction. Radio gas chromatography showed that palmitic acid was the most highly labeled acid, followed by stearic acid, in the mitochondrial fraction in accord with the pathway of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Some of the labeled acetate was also incorporated into the 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids of this fraction. Distribution of radioactivity among the mitochondrial lipid classes was highest in the phospholipids and monoglycerides, followed by diglycerides and cholesterol; little radioactivity was present in the triglyceride fraction.

The specific activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in liver microsomes was similar to that in the corresponding fractions of mammary glands of lactating mice.

Urine samples collected after competition were significantly lower in specific gravity, osmolarity and potassium concentration than samples obtained before the match.

Simultaneous determinations of arterial blood gases and pH were performed. The results of the vascular pressure measurements were compared with those obtained in 15 healthy young subjects. In all patients the pulmonary artery and pulmonary wedge pressure were normal at rest. During mild ergometer exercise, however, an abnormal rise in pulmonary artery pressure occurred in 9 patients. Moreover, an increased diastolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary vascular bed was found in some scoliotic patients indicating an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. It is supposed that this haemodynamic abnormality is primarily due to a restriction of the pulmonary vascular bed. Relationships between pulmonary artery pressure and arterial oxygen tension and blood pH, respectively, could be found. The possible significance of these results is discussed.',\n",

Tachyphylaxis to this effect of morphine was confirmed. Pretreatemnt with two 8 mg/kg doses of reserpine, 24 and 48 hrs before the experiment, significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold. The i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg dl-Dopa re-established the effect of morphine in reserpinized animals to the level of the untreated controls. Pretreatment with guanethidine (15 mg/kg) decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine. Phentolamine pretreatment (10 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine. Neither DCI nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect. Pretreatment with reserpine, guanethidine or phentolamine reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis. The possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by hypotenison would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of guanethidine or phentolamine did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given i.v. in this preparation.

Digestion of beta1NGF with carboxypeptidase B produced a dimer, beta3NGF, in which both chains lack these terminal arginine residues. Exposure of mixtures of beta1 and beta3NGF dimers to 8 M urea to produce monomers, followed by removal of urea to allow recombination, resulted in the formation of the hybrid beta2NGF, comprising one arginine-containing and one arginine-less chain, as well as the parent dimers. The amount of the three dimers formed was close to that expected from random association of monomers. Hybrid beta2NGF was also formed from mixtures of beta1 and beta3NGF where incubated at pH 2.6 to 4.5. The formation of beta2NGF has a half-time of 6 h at pH 4.0 and 4 degrees C. Its rate of formation decreased above pH 4.5, becoming minimal between pH 9.5 and pH 10.5, and increased with increasing temperature. The amount of beta2NGF formed was determined by the lowest pH to which the parent mixture was exposed, irrespective of its prior history. These data suggest that the hybrid is formed by the same mechanism in the absence and presence of the urea step. An approximate value for Kd, the equilibrium dissociation constant of the dimer equilibrium monomer equilibrium was derived. Its value was 3 - 10(-10) M at pH 4.0 and 4 degrees C. The alpha-subunit of 7S NGF decreased the rate of formation of beta2NGF not only at pHs where an alphabeta complex is stable, but also at an acid pH where no complex formation is observed by sedimentation analysis, suggesting that the present methodology offers a more sensitive probe of subunit interactions.

One such challenge arises from the presence of ammonia. Ammonia is an efficient biocide, its effect being dependent on pH as well as on concentration. The effects of pH and ammonia concentration were studied separately, where possible, on a variety of organisms, including some isolated from natural enviornments of high pH and/or ammonia concentration. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are both extremely sensitive to ammonia. An aerobic organism (growth up to pH 11.4) from an alkaline spring is more resistant, but exhibits a toxic response to ammonia at a pH much lower than its maximum for growth. The greatest ammonia resistance has been found in an unidentified organism growing at near neutral pH. Even in this case, however, survival at ammonia concentrations reasonably expected on the Jovian planets is measured in hours. This is, nevertheless, two to three orders of magnitude longer than for E. coli. Our data support the tentative conclusion that contamination of the Jovian planets with terrestrial organisms that can grow is unlikely. However, the range of toxic response noted, coupled with the observation that terrestrial life has not been exposed to high ammonia concentrations for millions of years, suggests that adaptation to greater ammonia tolerance may be possible.',\n",

The GGTP activity in the adult rats was low and amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.1 mumol/min/g. During fetal development the enzyme activity rose beginning on the 15th gestational day from 630 +/- 97 to 1,058 +/- 20 on the first postnatal day. Then the values declined and reached nearly adult values from the 10th postnatal day. After PCS the GGTP activity exhibited a three- to sixfold increase (130 +/- 69 to 371 +/- 131) as compared with unoperated adult controls (53 +/- 13). the highest levels corresponded to those observed between the 3rd and 5th postnatal day in the developing rats. The histochemistry of GTTP in the fetal and newborn liver showed a regular distribution of the enzyme as a fine deposit in the hepatocytes throughout the whole tissue. Ten days after birth the activity was low, at the same level as in the adult rat. In the period after PCS hepatocytes began to show signs of enzymatic activity at the periphery of the hepatic lobules, which subsequently spread through the whole lobules. The increase of GGTP activity after PCS equaled the activity found in fetal animals.

Electrical stimulation in the region of the hypothalamus in 10 acute experiments was associated with three patterns of arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes: a pressor-tachycardia response; a pure tachycardia response (abolished by propranolol); and a pure bradycardia response (abolished by atropine). The pressor-tachycardia response was examined in detail in 13 chronic preparations (115-135 days of gestation at operation). The systolic arterial blood pressure increase was never greater than 35 mm Hg and was probably blunted by the large noninnervated placental circulation. This pressure increase was abolished by phentolamine and was thus mediated by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The initial tachycardia was prevented by propranolol and was due to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The tachycardia was followed in a few seconds by a bradycardia, abolished by atropine and possibly a vagal baroreflex. The pressor-tachycardia response was accentuated in two lambs who were delivered spontaneously and were studied after birth. These studies indicate that a suprabulbar neural framework exists in the fetal lamb for influencing the cardiovascular system from as early as 90 days of gestation.',\n",

It was observed that the choline pathway, but not phosphatidylethanolamine methylation, is pH-sensitive with maximum rates occurring at pH levels between 7.3 and 7.5; significantly less activity was found at pH levels between 7.0 and 7.2 and at pH levels between 7.6 and 8.0. Adjustment of the pH from 7.0 to 7.4 in vitro simulating the clinical correction of acidosis by alkali infusion was found to increase the conversion of choline to lecithin to a rate approximating that observed at pH 7.4. Since lecithins are the principal phospholipid components of pulmonary surfactant, and since pathway 1 is predominantly responsible for lung lecithin synthesis, the demonstration of impaired production with reduced pH offers a biochemical explanation for the pathophysiological effects of acidosis in the respiratory distress syndrome. A comparison of pH effects on choline pathway rate with the pH profiles of pathway enzymes suggests that these effects are mediated by the catalysts of lecithin synthesis.',\n",

The Bohr effect is due to changes in the pK of specific carboxyl and amino groups of the four globin chains following the transition between the deoxy and oxy conformations of the molecule. Carbon dioxide binds to the N terminal valine of the 4 monomers to form carbamino compounds. This carbaminoformation depends upon pH, PCO2 and predominates on deoxygenated haemoglobin. It is lowered when O2 binds to the heme groups (O2 linked carbamino compounds). Through the carbamino compounds Carbon dioxide lowers both the affinity of haemoglobin for O2 and the Bohr effect. Diphosphoglycerate also binds to the haemoglogin molecule. This organophosphate lowers the affinity for O2 but increases the Bohr effect.

It has been shown that the above fractions are no metal enzymes. By means of the diazocarbonyl inhibitor an occurrence of a catalytically active carboxy group has been found in the active centre of proteinases. The proteinase inhibition by Fe3+ in the presence of citric acid is an indirect evidence of the existence of several carboxy groups and, possibly, of a hydroxy group in the active centre of acid proteinases from Aspergillus terricola.',\n",

The phospholipase activity of beta-bungarotoxin requires calcium and is stimulated by deoxycholate. When strontium replaces calcium, no phospholipase activity is detected. Since neuromuscular transmission is not blocked when calcium is replaced by strontium, it was possible to examine the effects of the toxin on neuromuscular transmission in the presence of strontium. Under these conditions, when the phospholipase activity should be inhibited, the toxin has little or no effect on neuromuscular transmission.

Cells of the variant form of XP characterized by normal DNA repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after UV, but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks.

Cell maintained in 2% dimethylsulfoxide remained in a stable nondividing condition for periods of up to 4 weeks. A high degree of electrical excitability was found in these cells, but there was no clear correlation of this property with the level of induction of either acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase; EC 3.1.1.7) or tyrosine hydroxylase [L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); EC 1.14.16.2]. In addition, intracellular levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP were not elevated in fully morphologically and electrically differentiated cells. While cell division was markedly inhibited by 2% or higher concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide, at 1% growth continued at a somewhat slowed rate and such cultures exhibited enhanced process formation and electrical activity for a relatively short period. High concentrations (3% or 4%) of dimethylsulfoxide totally suppressed process formation and did not result in increased excitability, but cells maintained high resting potentials. The results suggest that the development of the excitable membrane in neuroblastoma cells may be expressed independently of neurospecific enzyme induction, and does not require a sustained elevation of cyclic 3':5'-AMP levels.\",\n",

It is powerfully hemolytic for erythrocytes derived from a variety of animal species, those of the cat being the most sensitive and those of the guinea pig the most resistant. The toxin is lytic also for rabbit blood platelets, and it destroys cultured fibroblasts but is inactive for several kinds of bacterial protoplasts and spheroplasts. The hemolytic activity is specifically inhibited by sphingomyelin, and it is proposed that this phospholipid is the constituent of the membrane which functions as receptor for the toxin. Supporting evidence includes the findings that enzymes known to destroy sphingomyelin (a) prevent erythrocyte membranes from inhibiting hemolysis, and (b) render erythrocytes resistant to lysis by the toxin. The mechanism underlying hemolysis may involve translocation of membrane sphingomyelin by virtue of a specific affinity of the coelenterate protein for this phospholipid.',\n",

Clinical concentrations of local anesthetics inhibited this ATP-induced luminescence in a dose-dependent manner. From the effects of temperature and pH upon the inhibitory action of the local anesthetics, it is concluded that hydrophobic ligand-enzyme interaction is the predominant cause of the inhibition, but hydrophilic interaction also contributes to the inhibition to a lesser degree. A molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence. A similar mechanism is expected to occur at the cell membrane, which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane. These events lead to a volume expansion of the total system, and the system becomes reactive to a pressure which reverses the anesthesia by shifting the equilibrium to the nonanesthetized original volume. The pressure antagonism of anesthesia can be explained by this overall volume expansion and not by a mere swelling of the cell membrane.',\n",

The pH at which monellin is initially treated with denaturant is an important factor in retention of sweetness, but the pH maintained during subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis has no effect on activity. Recovery of sweetness of denaturant-treated monellin is favored when denaturation occurs at acid pH. Monellin treated with either 6 M guanidine-HCl or 8 M urea at acid pH retains all of its sweetness following removal of denaturant, but urea treatment at neutral pH leads to some irreversible loss of sweetness. Monellin precipitates from solution under some conditions during removal of denaturant by dialysis, and the precipitated protein is no longer sweet. Precipitation is least under acid conditions. Aggregated protein was demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. The single sulfhydryl group of monellin was not demonstrable in the precipitated protein, having apparently become oxidized during denaturation and formation of the aggregated protein.

       "  'abstract': 'The genetic apparatus of the cell is responsible for the accurate biosynthesis of the primary structure of macromolecules which then spontaneously fold up and, in certain circumstances, aggregate to yield the complex tertiary and quaternary structures of the biologically active molecules. Structures capable of self-assembly in this range from simple monomers through oligomers to complex multimeric structures that may contain more than one type of polypeptide chain and components other than protein. It is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is becoming clear that even with the simpler monomeric enzymes there is a kinetically determined pathway for the folding process and that a folded protein must now be regarded as the minimum free energy form of the kinetically accessible conformations. It is argued that the denatured subunits of oligomeric enzymes are likely to fold to something like their final structure before aggregating to give the native quaternary structure and the available evidence would suggest that this is so. The importance of nucleation events and stable intermediates in the self-assembly of more complex structures is clear. Many self-assembling structures contain only identical subunits and symmetry arguments are very successful in accounting for the structures formed. Because proteins are themselves complex molecules and not inelastic geometric objects, the rules of strict symmetry can be bent and quasi-equivalent bonding between subunits permitted. This possibility is frequently employed in biological structures. Conversely, symmetry arguments can offer a reliable means of choosing between alternative models for a given structure. It can be seen that proteins gain stability by growing larger and it is argued in evolutionary terms that aggregation of subunits is the preferred way to increase the size of proteins. The possession of quaternary structure by enzymes allows conferral of other biologically important properties, such as cooperativity between active sites, changes of specificity, substrate channelling and sequential reactions within a multi-enzyme complex. Comparison is made of the invariant subunit compositions of the simpler oligomeric enzymes with the variation evidently open to, say, the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes of E. coli. With viruses, on the other hand, the function of the quaternary structure is to package nucleic acid and, as an example, the assembly and breakdown of tobacco mosaic virus is discussed. Attention is drawn to the possible ways in which the principles of self-assembly can be extended to make structures more complicated than those that can be formed by simple aggregation of the comonent parts.',\n",

Both sites are developmentally regulated. An adequate stimulus for the chemoreceptor system in D. discoideum is the change of cAMP concentration in time, rather than concentration per se: long-term binding of cAMP causes only short-term response. The system is, consequently, adapted to the recognition of pulses rather than to steady-state concentrations of cAMP. The ce,lls are, nevertheless, able to sense stationary spatial gradients and to respond to them by chemotactic orientation. The possibility is discussed that they do so by transforming spatial concentration changes into temporal ones, using extending pseudopods as sensors. The cAMP recognition system is part of a molecular network involved in the generation of spatio-temporal patterns of cellular activities. This system controls the periodic formation of chemotactic signals and their propagation from cell to cell. The phosphodiesterase limits the duration of the cAMP pulses and thus sharply separates the periods of signalling; the binding sites at the cell surface are supposed to be the chemoreceptors. The control of cellular activities via cAMP receptors can be studied with biochemical techniques with cell suspensions in which spatial inhomogeneities are suppressed by intense stirring, whereas the temporal aspect of the spatiotemporal pattern is preserved. Under these conditions it can be shown that the extracellular cAMP concentration changes periodically, and that the phase of the cellular oscillator can be shifted by external pulses of cAMP. It can also be shown that small cAMP pulses induce a high output of cAMP, which demonstrates signal amplification, a function necessary for a cellular relay system.',\n",

Biological systems are more highly selective and much more rapid. Methods of maintaining an optimum concentration, including storage and transfer for the essential trace elements, copper and iron, used in some organisms are in part reproducible by coordination chemists while other features have not been reporduced in models. Poisoning can result from a foreign metal taking part in a reaction irreversibly so that the recognition site or molecule is not released. For major nutrients, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, there are similarities to the trace metals in selective uptake but differences qualitatively and quantitatively in biological activity. Compounds selective for potassium replace all the solvation sphere with a symmetrical arrangement of oxygen atoms; those selective for sodium give an asymmetrical environment with retention of a solvent molecule. Experiments with naturally occurring antibiotics and synthetic model compounds have shown that flexibility is an important feature of selectivity and that for transfer or carrier properties there is an optimum (as opposed to a maximum) metal-ligand stability constant. Thallium is taken up instead of potassium and will activate some enzymes; it is suggested that the poisonous characteristics arise because the thallium ion may bind more strongly than potassium to part of a site and then fail to bind additional atoms as required for the biological activity.

The long-range interactions may be subdividied into electrostatic, induction and dispersion contributions, where the electrostatic component is the interaction of the permanent charge distributions and the others originate in the fluctuations in the distributions. Typical magnitudes of the various contributions are given. The forces between macroscopic bodies are briefly considered, as are the effects of a medium.

       "  'abstract': 'This paper reports the initial progress in a research programme to identify and obtain the relative orientations, in solution, of the amino acid residues that constitute the combining site of the myeloma protein MOPC 315. This protein has a molecular mass of 150,000, but enzymic digestion yields the Fv fragment of molecular mass 25,000 which still has the combining site intact, as judged by the affinity for dinitrophenyl haptens. Analysis of the e.s.r. spectra of a series of dinitrophenyl spin labelled haptens has allowed the dimensions, rigidity and polarity profile of the combining site to be determined. The combining site is a cleft of overall dimensions 1.1 nm x 0.9 nm x 0.6 nm which has considerable structural rigidity. One of these spin labels has also been used to perturb the n.m.r. spectrum of the Fv and using difference spectroscopy the 270 MHz proton n.m.r. spectrum of the amino acid residues in and around the combining site has been obtained. This spectrum contains only the equivalent of about 30 aromatic and 21 aliphatic protons. Comparison of this difference spectrum with that obtained using a diamagnetic analogue suggests that any conformational changes on hapten binding are mainly localized to the combining site. By the use of (n.m.r.) difference spectroscopy the protons of the three histidine residues in the Fv are observed to titrate with pH and have pKa values of about 8.1, 6.9 and 6.1. The histidine resonances with pKa values 6.9 and 6.1 alter slightly in the presence of haptens and also appear in the spin label difference spectrum, and must therefore be in or near to the combining site. These are assigned to His 102H and His 97L. The existence of lanthanide binding sites on the Fv, necessary for the mapping studies, has been demonstrated by measurements of Gd III water relaxation rates in Fv solutions and also by the changes in the Fv tryptophan fluorescence on addition of Gd III. At pH 5.5 there is one tight binding site for the lanthanides (KD approximately 80 muM) but in the presence of hapten this is weakened 10-20 fold with a reciprocal effect on the hapten binding. Measurements of the Gd III quenching of the e.s.r. spectrum of a spin labelled hapten bound to Fv indicate that the lanthanide site is ca. 1.5 nm from the nitroxide moiety.',\n",

The binding site of trypsin orients the substrate so that the reacting groups are correctly placed for reaction to occur. Apart from two side chains which take part in chemical steps of the reaction, the enzyme behaves almost as a rigid body. The full binding interactions are only developed when the substrate is in an intermediate stage of the reaction. The tightly bound complexes of trypsin with protein trypsin inhibitors have proved amenable to structural analysis. Enzyme inhibitor interactions, which account for almost 80 kJ mol-1 of interaction energy, are known fairly accurately. The similarity of the two known trypsin inhibitor structures, close to the primary binding site, indicates a high specificity, even for this simple interaction.

       "  'abstract': 'Four possible metabolic approaches to improving cardiac function in the presence of myocardial hypoxia have been considered. 1. It appears that there is increasing evidence which suggests that free fatty acids are harmful to the ischemic heart. 2. Although it has been demonstrated that Krebs cycle intermediates can result in anaerobic energy formation by the mitochondria, and under certain extreme conditions can lead to improved performance of the heart, the potential for a physiologically important effect of this approach is probably limited. 3. The protection of the ischemic or hypoxic heart by alkalosis may be a feasible approach. The major beneficial effect appears to be exerted through more efficient conversion of energy that is already available to contractile performance rather than by increasing energy supply. 4. There appears to be some real potential for improving cardiac energy delivery via the glycolytic pathway. Calculations based on isolated rat heart studies indicate that, at 50% oxygenation, glycolytic ATP generation could totally correct for the deficit in mitochondrial ATP formation. Therefore, it is in the area of overcoming the inhibition of glycolytic ATP formation and tapping this potential metabolic pathway that energy delivery may be restored toward normal in the hypoxic and perhaps the borderline zone of underperfusion in the ischemic heart. The problem of the ischemic inhibition of glycolysis may partially be overcome by creating extracellular alkalosis, but this presumption will have to be tested.',\n",

In the presence of 5.5 mM glucose, 10(-5) M isoproterenol and alkaline pH (7.8) improved the performance of cardiac muscle during early hypoxia. This was followed by a premature decline in developed tension, and contracture appeared. Recovery of function following reoxygenation with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 after a 60-min period of hypoxia was poor. Acid pH (6.8) resulted in an early decline of mechanical activity during hypoxia; but contracture did not appear, and full recovery of developed tension was seen upon reoxygenation after 60 min of hypoxia. When 22 mM glucose was used as substrate, the early responses to hypoxia were not altered; but late performance was improved, contracture did not appear, and full recovery after 60 min of hypoxia was seen. If additional glucose was added to the bath after 30 min of hypoxia (concentration 22 mM), little effect on developed tension was evident; but contracture diminished and recovery after 60 min of hypoxia was improved. Addition of 22 mM glucose allowed isoproterenol to exert its inotropic effect in the absence of late deleterious changes. The data support the concept that factors tending to increase the utilization of limited stores of anaerobic substrate during hypoxia facilitate deterioration. By increasing exogenous glucose, the support of inotropic activity without late adverse effects appears possible, and recovery is improved upon reoxygenation.',\n",

Bacterial survival in the maxillary sinus despite a high antibiotic concentration in the sinus illustrates that MIC values determined in the laboratory do not always mirror the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics in vivo.',\n",

The membrane employed consisted of an ordinary silicone rubber tubing, 2 mm internal diameter, 0.3 mm wall thickness, the length of the tubing varying according to the required gas transfer. When describing the capacity of the oxygenator, it was found that the maximum gas transfer rate per unit membrane surface was an inadequate measure, since this would vary with both flow rate through the oxygenator and the gas binding capacity of the perfusate. The following formula for the function describing the relation between maximally possible change in gas concentration in the perfusate (C), flow rate (F) and actual change in gas concentration in the perfusate (U) was proposed: U=C-e(-bF), b being a constant specific for the gas and the membrane. This formula was tested by a series of in vitro experiments and proved to give a valid description of the capacity of the oxygenator. It was also found that carbon dioxide was always more easily transferred than oxygen, so that oxygen transfer capcity was the limiting factor in the use of the oxygenator.

Particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery. The effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an electromagnetic flowmeter. During arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm, the subclavian flow diminished, as did the vertebral artery flow when it was retrograde. If the vertebral artery flow was anterograde, it increased during arm ischaemia. The postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow. If the vertebral flow was anterograde, it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia. Similar findings were obtained with intra-arterial injection of a vasodilator. The large amount of blood flow passing through the vertebral artery, as well as the flow variations caused by reactive arm hyperaemia, emphasize the role of this artery as a collateral vessel to the upper limb in cases of the subclavian steal phenomenon.',\n",

The resultant hepatic histology is reported. A study of the binding and metabolism of fluroxene by isolated rat hepatic microsomes was also made. We conclude that it is elevated levels of cytochrome P-450 which potentiate the toxicity of fluroxene anaesthesia in phenobarbital treated animals and that cytochrome P-448 does not bind or metabolize fluroxene.

The delta5-3beta Hut optimal pH, specific activity and sensitivity to the inhibitory action of various steroids are different when C19 and C21 steroids are used as substrates. Estrogens and cyclic AMP have also an inhibitory action on the oxidation of C21 steroids.

The amount of collagen hydrolyzed by it composed 6.6% and 16% after 4-hour and 6-hour hydrolysis, respectively. When the enzyme:substrate ratio is 1:50 hydrolysis proceeds most intensively; with a decrease in the ratio up to 1:1000 the average amount of peptides increase from 2.6 up to 4 amino acidic residua, respectively. Under conditions of denaturated collagen hydrolysis the content of hydroxyproline in solution as compared with the native one increases; in this case the links with the presence of imino-acids are easier to split, the more resistant being those formed by hydroxyproline. Within the limit of 20-45 degrees C hydrolysis of protein intensifies with a temperature rise. Within the pH range of 5.0-11.0 the maximal amount of alpha- NH2-groups and hydroxyproline is observed at pH 8.5, the minimal--at PH 5.0. Hydroxyproline in the composition of peptides appears at the beginning of hydrolysis whereas the free one of enzymes of the longer effect 24 h after the beginning of the experiment composes 12.2% of its total content in the solved products. In the insoluble part of the substrate after 3-hour hydrolysis tyrosine composes less than 25% of its initial amount in protein whereas phenyl alanine--over 70%.

More characteristic changes linked with pregnancy were observed in the cell composition of the amniotic fluids. With advancing in age the increase in cell count was accompanied (staining with Nile blue sulfate) with a rise of the \"orange cell\" content. The amniotic fluids of ewes with normal pregnancy were found to contain proteins which precipitated with hyper immune sera against blood serum and kidney, heart, and placenta proteins.

       "  'abstract': 'In dogs with elaborated rhythmic and mozaic stereotypes of secretory and motor situational conditioned reflexes specific features were revealed in the action of some neurotropic drugs (amizyl, amedine, diphacil, pediphene, chlorpromazine and sodium oxybutyrate) on preparatory (latent) conditions of excitation and inhibition, appearing in the stabilized systems of reflexes. Pharmacological analysis has pointed to the predominantly cholinergic nature of preparatory and trigger mechanisms of alimentary conditioned activity. The blockade of M-cholinoreceptors (by means of amizyl and amedine) weakens or eliminates the preparatory conditions appearing in a dynamic stereotype and disturbs the trigger reactions within three to ten days. A pediphene blockade of H-cholinoreceptors intensifies the preparatory states.',\n",

Numerous examinations have shown that it is well tolerated by mouth and that it has beneficial clinical effects with few side effects. Benorylate is a neutral, fat-soluble, water-insoluble substance which upon absorption is almost completely hydrolyzed into salicylate and paracetamol. 6 patients with classical seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and with a highly active synovialitis of one or both knee joints not previously treated received 4 g of a 40% benorylate suspension orally twice daily over a period of 9-14 days. On different days at exactly determined times of drug administration blood, and on the day of synovectomy synovial fluid and synovial tissue, were taken and frozen to - 70 degrees C and subsequently examined as to the content of salicylate, paracetamol, and unchanged benorylate. The plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were generally distinctly higher than the concentrations of these metabolites in the synovial fluid. Benorylate which is practically not detectable in blood is found in the synovial tissue and is detectable in greatest quantities in the most inflamed synovial villi. Benorylate can probably penetrate into the synovial membrane like its metabolites salicylate and paracetamol; it remains, however, to be examined whether the metabolites are distributed differently in different synovial areas (active inflamed and unattacked synovial tissue, respectively) in the same way as benorylate per se.',\n",

The results of the metabolite measurements gave no evidence of tissue hypoxia in spite of the pronounced reduction in CBF.
